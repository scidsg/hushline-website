When I was working with the team, Moxie traveled down to Menlo Park to personally work with the WhatsApp team to integrate the Signal Protocol. It was a normal, slow morning when he said that it was done and deployed, almost as an \u201coh, by the way,\u201d kind of thing, and it was at that moment, my mind exploded. Just like that, 1,000,000,000 (one billion) WhatsApp users worldwide had the strongest encryption on the market. Now, it\u2019s used by two of the top four most-used messaging apps in the world, so by all counts, the scale of their positive impact deserves a Nobel Prize, in my opinion. Having said that, Signal itself isn\u2019t among the top 10 most used apps in the United States.\nA more recent story: I was visiting one of my besties, whose son I\u2019m the godfather of, who is now 19 years old and studying cybersecurity. Since my career has been in software, and most recently in the security and privacy space, I was eager to introduce him to influential people I know and to try to give him real-world experience, maybe with work on Hush Line. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to intro you to ppl, let\u2019s move to Signal\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s Signal?\u201d was the reply to which I had to put my phone down and take a breath before replying, \u201cOh, young one\u2026\u201d"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"your-tip-line-strategy",children:"Your Tip Line Strategy"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Should you abandon Signal?
