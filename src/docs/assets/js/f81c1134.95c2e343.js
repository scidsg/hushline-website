I was almost their first full-time designer when the team was only four people with a physical office back in the Mission in San Francisco. I turned the offer down because I was too junior in my career to feel like I could be as effective as I knew I could be with more time at the Big Tech company I worked for... \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n...I volunteered, rejecting even being paid for my time since I had a job that paid enough. And I personally use Signal almost exclusively, so there\u2019s no shade when I say emphatically (especially looking at you, journalists), \u201cSignal is not enough!\u201d Below, we\u2019ll look at internet and messaging usage data in the United States to inform a data-informed tip line strategy.\\n\\n## The Data\\nThere\u2019s a particular bias against anything but Signal if you\u2019re a journalist in the US, but this bias seriously hurts your potential impact. When I worked with the team, adoption was one of the biggest problems to solve as they were hovering around 100K users, even with the stamp of approval from Snowden. Now, the app has had a nearly 700x increase in users at around 70M globally! It\u2019s excellent news for the team at Signal \u2014 a foundation was created (just for Signal), a billionaire is their chairman, and their future is all but guaranteed.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./signal-users.webp)\\nSignal Users Globally from 2019\u20132024\\nHowever the total number of internet users in 2025 is ~5.5B worldwide, and Signal is but ~1.3% of that total share.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./internet-users.png)\\nTotal Internet and Social Users in 2025\\nOkay, so Signal might have a modest share of the total pie, but people in the US must get it, right? Looking at the top messaging apps, it doesn\u2019t seem so. In fact, Signal isn\u2019t in the top 10.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./phone-usage.png)\\nTop Messaging Apps in the United States\\nHere\u2019s a personal story that I think about all the time. When I was working with the team, Moxie traveled down to Menlo Park to personally work with the WhatsApp team to integrate the Signal Protocol. It was a normal, slow morning when he said that it was done and deployed, almost as an \u201coh, by the way,\u201d kind of thing, and it was at that moment, my mind exploded. Just like that, 1,000,000,000 (one billion) WhatsApp users worldwide had the strongest encryption on the market. Now, it\u2019s used by two of the top four most-used messaging apps in the world, so by all counts, the scale of their positive impact deserves a Nobel Prize, in my opinion. Having said that, Signal itself isn\u2019t among the top 10 most used apps in the United States.\\nA more recent story: I was visiting one of my besties, whose son I\u2019m the godfather of, who is now 19 years old and studying cybersecurity. Since my career has been in software, and most recently in the security and privacy space, I was eager to introduce him to influential people I know and to try to give him real-world experience, maybe with work on Hush Line. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to intro you to ppl, let\u2019s move to Signal\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s Signal?\u201d was the reply to which I had to put my phone down and take a breath before replying, \u201cOh, young one\u2026\u201d\\n\\n## Your Tip Line Strategy\\nShould you abandon Signal? Absolutely not. But it can\u2019t be your only solution for people to reach you. Other solutions like Proton Mail have emerged as great, lower-friction options, but as of 2023, even they only have 100M users, less than 2% of all internet users.\\nOn the other hand, email is used by ~4.5B users worldwide. But what\u2019s better than ~4.5B users? What about everyone? Now, let\u2019s talk about Hush Line.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./submit-message.png)\\nAnyone internet user can send a message\\nHush Line is our anonymous reporting platform that doesn\u2019t require internet users to create an account or download any apps to use. Tip Line owners can have messages forwarded to their email service of choice, and messages are end-to-end encrypted. Someone submitting a message with an elevated threat model can use our Onion Service to access Hush Line anonymously using Tor Browser.\\n\\n## Get Going\\nThe best news? We\u2019re free, open-source, and non-profit managed. Our team has worked on the most ubiquitous secure messaging platforms in the world, and we deeply care about making it easy for whistleblowers to find help. Are you making it harder than it needs to be for vulnerable people who need help? If you\u2019re only using Signal, the answer is yes.\\nSign up for Hush Line at https://tips.hushline.app/register."}]}}')}}]);
