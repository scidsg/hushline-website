                                of encryption or technology will keep you private. The lesson: never use your

                                to connect to a site you want to keep private.</p>

                            <p>When thinking about blowing the whistle, always consider: What are you protecting, and
                                who are you protecting it from? Is it a message to the local newspaper about the noisy
                                neighborhood construction, an abusive business owner, or a corrupt local official? You
                                can connect using our clearnet address and have confidence you'll remain anonymous.</p>
                            <p>Or are you sharing national security secrets from within an authoritarian government that
                                censors their internet and murders journalists? This is not legal advice, but a
                                reasonable, though possibly prohibitively complex, way to ensure anonymity may be to
                                somehow acquire and use a Tor-only amnesiac operating system like Tails or Qubes with a
                                Whonix disposable VM on an uncompromised burner device where you'll encrypt your message
                                locally before ever connecting the device to the internet. When you connect to the Hush
                                Line Onion service, it should be on an uncompromised network you do not own, to which
                                you are not related, and that isn't near your residence. Oh, and don't go anywhere that
                                uses surveillance cameras or biometric identification, only use cash and don't go to an
                                ATM near where you'll buy the device, leave your primary cell phone at home, don't check
                                in to any location requiring your real name or ID, and if you have a car with a GPS in
                                it, don't drive it. Reasonable, right? This might sound like a lot, but the point is
                                that there is no one way to use Hush Line or "perfect" anonymity. You must consider your
                                own situation uniquely. No matter what tool you use to send a message, if you share
                                sensitive enough information about an individual or entity with enough time, money, and
                                power, operational security will always be critically important.</p>

                            <p>Signal is great, but it requires the whistleblower to download a new app, register with a valid phone number, create a username, and more. While not the largest hurdle, it is still a hurdle, placing requirements on the whistleblower before they can find help. In contrast, Hush Line is web-based and requires no account for the whistleblower or no new app downloads. It removes all hurdles from potential truth-tellers, freeing them from worrying about a new secure communication protocol and instead focusing on their message and not the technology.</p>
                            <p>Hush Line aims to be the first step for whistleblowers. When they don't know what to do first or next, a safe and effortless way to contact the right person should be the least of their worries.

                            <p>SecureDrop is a robust whistleblowing platform whose architecture is necessitated by very
                                specific use cases: A.) To safely manage files sent by anonymous people so that a device
                                or network isn't accidentally compromised, and B.) To provide a censorship-resistant and
                                anonymous method of sending those files. When someone submits a message, an account is
                                created for them, allowing two-way communication. To use SecureDrop:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Do A LOT. SecureDrop is an "on-prem" solution, requiring you to store multiple
                                    servers locally, all focused on isolated tasks, using a dedicated network. Think of
                                    SecureDrop as a fixed workflow for receiving and handling potentially malicious
                                    files. You must do all of the things correctly to assume safe operation. It requires
                                    a lot of time, which means a lot of money. The installation and setup of the system,
                                    in most cases, needs to be conducted by a member of the SD team, with service
                                    contracts helping to ensure proper maintenance of the infrastructure.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The message submitter must:</p>

                                <li>Check back for progress.</li>

                            <p>Hush Line is not a replacement for SecureDrop. Instead, it's for organizations who might
                                not have the staff required to manage such a system or need nation-state levels of
                                defense for all of their anonymous tips. We simplify our security model by being a text-only
                                service, meaning there is no possibility of receiving files that could harm your
                                computer or network.</p>
                            <p>We're a managed service, so you don't have to worry about maintaining physical
                                infrastructure or learning new workflows. In fact, to use Hush Line, you don't even have
                                to log back into the service after setting it up. We can deliver messages directly to
                                your email inbox, so you can set it, forget it, and never miss a beat. Users can add
                                their own public PGP key, giving them end-to-end encryption and ensuring messages cannot
                                be read by anyone but them.</p>
                            <p>Hush Line is also available on a clearnet address, or through our Onion service. Using
                                the browser already on your computer or phone, you can easily submit a message without
                                ever downloading a new app. Users who need higher levels of anonymity may optionally use
                                our Onion service, requiring them to download Tor Browser. This flexibility allows for
                                our service to be used for benign use cases or elevated threat levels.</p>

                            <p>We use Python and the Flask framework because they're well-documented and supported. The
                                developer ecosystem is rich with extensions for everything from user authentication to
                                message encryption. Python is also one of the most used languages, making the project
                                accessible to a greater number of engineers.</p>

                            <p>Receiving files comes with significant risk, and the functionality is only sometimes
                                necessary. It can lead to compromising your device, network, and any other device
                                connected to it.</p>
                            <p>For the sender, acquiring and sending files is one of the riskiest things they can
                                attempt to do. Take the case of <a

                                the document she shared detailing Russian interference in the US elections could be
                                easily traced back to the originating printer, and from there, it was trivial to learn
                                who printed it. She spent four years in prison. Or of <a

                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea Manning</a>, whose chat logs
                                revealing war crimes led to the evidence bringing her conviction. She spent seven years

                            <p>Moreover, we challenge the need to immediately receive files by asking the question:
                                Should you be receiving files anonymously without any baseline level of trust? If so,
                                there are tools for that, but we don't recommend starting with them.</p>
