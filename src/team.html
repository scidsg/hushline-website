                </h2>
                <p>Hush Line is built by individuals who want to advance truth in the public interest, protect 
                    tip line owners and whistleblowers, and make usable privacy tools for everyone.
                </p>
                <p> Hush Line started as a project of Science &amp; Design, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. 
                     In 2025, Science &amp; Design, Inc. rebranded as Hush Line, allowing us to focus entirely on 
                     developing and growing this platform and supporting the whistleblower community.
