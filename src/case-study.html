            <p>A whistleblower is an insider to an organization who exposes
              evidence of wrongdoing to authorities or the press with the
              intention of reforming it [1]. Not just an activity for exposing
              National Security secrets, whistleblowing can help make schools
              safer, businesses more compliant and ethical, and journalists more
              informed.</p>
            <p>Disclosing secrets is vitally important and simultaneously one of
              the most dangerous things an individual can do, especially in the
              context of government and national security secrets. People who
              leak information often go into it without a plan, leading to
              exile, imprisonment, and even death. To protect against the
              discovery of someone leaking documents, many tools available today
              offer Tor-only solutions — meaning the tools they use to upload
              documents are only accessible through special software providing
              anonymizing connections to the internet. While an essential piece
              of the puzzle, requiring someone to download software that could
              make them look suspicious as the only way to share information is
              a non-starter, especially for people in countries where internet
              freedoms are restricted.</p>
            <p>But what about the students who need to have a safe way to report
              information to educators about school safety, teacher misconduct,
              or struggles at home? Or the businesses that need methods for
              employees to report information that could lead to legal
              liabilities, including SEC violations or other lawsuits, without
              risking their careers and livelihoods? Or journalists who need an
              easy and safe way to receive information without requiring the
              public to learn a new esoteric technology?</p>
            <p>In this paper, we’ll see how Hush Line can meet all threat
              models, from nation-states to neighborhoods, by providing a
              product suite that is both usable by non-technical individuals and
              also highly resilient to censorship and surveillance.</p>

          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>Most people will witness workplace harassment or discrimination,
              yet very few speak up [2]. The fear of retaliation creates a
              chilling effect that enables bad behavior that could lead to SEC
              violations or other legal risks for the company. In schools,
              students today have to go through active shooter drills and worry
              about gun violence, yet are afraid to speak up if it’ll risk their
              reputation. And the business of journalism is changing, with
              budgets shrinking by 25% over the last decade [3]. How, too,
              should our tools evolve?</p>
            <p>This paper presents Hush Line, a new managed whistleblowing
              platform designed with usability, accessibility, privacy, and
              security in mind. Hush Line is designed to be a managed service,
              meaning anyone can come to the platform at https://hushline.app,
              create an account without providing any personally identifying
              information (PII), and have an anonymous tip line. Where others
              require specialized infrastructure to manage a tip line, Hush Line
              does this for you so that you can focus on the mission, not the
              machines.</p>
            <p>One of Hush Line’s strengths is its flexibility, deploying to
              both a clear web address (https://hushline.app) and a Tor Onion
              Service (http://j5k...2ad.onion) for users who require advanced
              levels of anonymity. If, for example, a journalist only needs a
              Tor-only option, they may choose never to disclose our clear web
              address to their audience and only share their onion address
              (http://j5k...2ad.onion/tips/submit_message/artvandelay). And for
              the cases where it is critical to offer an address reachable by
              regular browsers — Firefox, Sarafi, Chrome — a user may choose
              only to share the clearweb URL
              (https://hushline.app/tips/submit_message/artvandelay).</p>
            <p>For users who do need complete control of their infrastructure,
              we offer a product called the Hush Line Personal Server, a
              physical device that runs your own instance of the Hush Line
              platform and deploys as a Tor-only service. For those who want to
              host the Hush Line platform on their own infrastructure, we
              provide an official software package on the GitHub Container
              Registry [4]. Our product is free and open-source for those who
              want even more control of the code, allowing anyone to copy and
              modify it for their needs.</p>
            <p>To understand our target audiences’ needs and requirements, we
              interviewed former whistleblowers, lawyers specializing in
              whistleblowing law, journalists, educators, and business owners.
              In addition, we also ran a beta program for approximately six
              months to test an early prototype of the platform with real users
              and to gather first-hand feedback. During the beta period, we
              identified and successfully addressed vulnerabilities in the
              prototype with the community’s support, leading to a more robust
              production application. We spoke to authors of previous research
              papers, former whistleblowers, and lawyers specializing in
              whistleblower law.</p>
            <p>Hush Line will serve as a product that meets users’ needs across
              threat models and use cases. We remove the need for technical
              proficiency or complex requirements and offer a platform and
              interaction model that people are already familiar with. We hope
              this approach, which focuses on usability, accessibility, privacy,
              and security will lead to a more informed public, safer schools,
              and more ethical businesses.</p>

            <h3>The Problems We’re Solving</h3>
            <h4>Journalism</h4>
            <p>It’s not unique to Journalism, but from 2008 through 2020, there
              was a 26% decrease in newsroom headcount, totaling about 30,000
              employees [5]. With the realities of the changing workplace, tools
              requiring significant people-time, training, and maintenance are
              hard to justify. The software offered to journalists must meet
              them where they are, not require they change their behavior. Hush
              Line delivers end-to-end encrypted messages directly in your inbox
              so you don’t have to download another app.</p>

            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>A 16-year study of one school showed that the feeling of safety
              went down when they implemented physical security measures,
              including metal detectors and gates and removing decorative
              elements from campus. Peer violence increased, calls to the police
              quadrupled, and teachers grew increasingly concerned [6]. Speaking
              with students in West Oakland, California, one 10-year-old girl
              said that if necessary, she would report information, but only if
              it wouldn’t impact her reputation. How might schools be safer if
              there was a trustworthy way for students to privately communicate
              with trusted educators?</p>

            <h4>Business</h4>
            <p>Up to 90% of women in the restaurant industry experience sexual
              assault or harassment [7], and 61% of all workers will witness or
              experience workplace harassment or discrimination. Stemming from
              fear of retaliation, fewer than 1 in 3 will make a formal
              complaint, and fewer than 1% find victory in court [8].</p>
            <p>Conversely, businesses can incur substantial penalties for SEC
              violations or other offenses that could have been caught sooner.
              In 2023, global tech company AAB Ltd. agreed to pay a $75 million
              civil penalty for bribery-related charges. Goldman Sachs paid a $6
              million civil penalty for a decade of fraudulent behavior, during
              which they made more than 22,000 deficient financial transactions
              [9].</p>

            <h3>The Price of Whistleblowing</h3>
            <p>Whistleblowing is a risky endeavor. The examples below illustrate
              that tools alone are never enough. We’ll see stories highlighting
              different avenues individuals have taken and their outcomes.</p>

            <h4>Edward Snowden</h4>
            <p>One of the most influential whistleblowers of the last decades is
              Edward Snowden. He leaked a cache of documents he collected about
              NSA mass surveillance to journalists. His whistleblowing led to
              legislative reform in the USA, increased public awareness about
              whistleblowing and mass surveillance operations in America, and
              inspired the creation of new products designed to allow safer
              sharing of information for whistleblowers, including Signal,
              OnionShare, and even Hush Line.</p>
            <p>Snowden, easily one of the more technical whistleblowers of
              recent memory, was familiar with Tor and used Tails [10], an
              operating system that deletes all data when it shuts down, and
              whose traffic is completely tunneled through the Tor Network. Yet
              when he needed to securely contact journalists, he found the
              journalists lacked the technical ability to set up encrypted
              communications correctly. Snowden couldn’t find journalist Glenn
              Greenwald’s public PGP key, and even when Greenwald did get it
              configured with the help of Micah Lee [11], Snowden forgot to
              attach his own key in a message so Greenwald could privately
              respond. Snowden understood how the system worked and which
              technologies were resistant to surveillance, yet despite his
              knowledge, he is now exiled in Russia [12].</p>

            <h4>Chelsea Manning</h4>
            <p>Chelsea Manning is a former Army private who, working with Julian
              Assange of WikiLeaks, leaked information that included evidence of
              war crimes committed by the US [13].</p>
            <p>While Chelsea had technical skills, she was living in the chaos
              of war, and was eventually caught because she shared information
              in an online chat with Adrian Lamo, a former hacker turned
              government informant, who reported the information to the FBI,
              which included evidence of Manning’s crimes. Chelsea Manning spent
              seven years in prison before President Obama pardoned her in 2017
              [14].</p>

            <h4>Andrew Aude</h4>
            <p>Andrew Aude [15] is a former Apple software engineer who used
              Signal on his work-issued device for years to share confidential
              information with a journalist. Messages included trade secrets,
              financial information, and details about product roadmaps and
              launch dates.</p>
            <p>Despite his technical proficiency — passing the impressive
              standard of Apple employment — and using Signal, he was caught.
              Though the encryption was strong, and even if he were using an
              anonymizing VPN or Tor, his error was using a device issued by his
              employer.</p>
            <p>Mobile device management (MDM) software allows your employer to
              provision and manage hardware devices like mobile phones, tablets,
              or computers. Especially for a company like Apple, which employs
              ~164,000 people, MDM software enables your employer, for example,
              to make sure proprietary apps for employee resources like HR or
              Legal are available to everyone immediately or apply consistent
              and timely security updates or make sure everyone’s VPN
              credentials are correctly configured without hoping that hundreds
              of thousands of employees to get it right on their own. MDM
              software can also take screenshots or live-monitor any device in
              its network. So despite doing a lot of things right, if your
              adversary can take a screenshot of your conversation, it doesn’t
              matter what app or tech you use to protect your data.</p>

            <h4>John Barnett</h4>
            <p>John Barnett was a Boeing whistleblower and former quality
              manager who disclosed safety concerns using official governmental
              channels with the 787s being made in his factory [16]. He filed an
              official complaint with the US Labor Department under an official
              whistleblower protection program [16]. He’d eventually bring a
              lawsuit against the company for the retaliation he experienced
              after sharing information with the Labor Department.</p>
            <p>John Barnett was at no time anonymous in his reporting and
              disclosing safety concerns about the Boeing 787. He ultimately
              experienced retaliation from Boeing because of this information
              sharing, and filed a lawsuit against them. It was during this
              period of engaging in a public lawsuit with Boeing, that he was
              found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot [16].</p>

            <h3>Security Goals and Principles</h3>
            <p>Through speaking to former whistleblowers, journalists, and
              lawyers, and by reading academic papers published worldwide, we
              arrived at a set of guiding goals and principles:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Usability</b>: No matter how technically advanced your
                software is, adoption will fail if a whistleblower can’t use
                it.</li>
              <li><b>Authenticity</b>: Whistleblowers must have confidence
                they’re communicating with the right person.</li>
              <li><b>Deniability</b>: Requiring whistleblowers to download
                software that could land someone in jail is a non-starter.</li>
              <li><b>Availability</b>: Whistleblowers must be able to access
                your software when they need it.</li>
              <li><b>Anonymity</b>: Software makers must do everything they can
                to protect source anonymity.</li>
              <li><b>Confidentiality</b>: Messages must remain secret.
                Communication between whistleblowers and other parties is
                protected and not the business of the software makers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Current Tools</h3>
            <p>To better understand why a tool like Hush Line is necessary, we
              should consider two things: 1. the needs of the whistleblower and
              2. the tools currently available (Table 1). In this paper, we’ll
              focus on three leading tools that provide examples of managed
              services, self-hosted options, and on-prem solutions: Signal,
              GlobaLeaks, and Secure Drop.</p>

            <h4>Secure Drop</h4>
            <p>SecureDrop [25] is a tool maintained by the Freedom of the Press
              Foundation [27], a 501(c)(3) focusing on defending journalism
              around the world. Created originally by Aaron Swartz and then
              inherited by FPF, it is a self-hosted system consisting of
              different servers for receiving, viewing, and handling files on
              dedicated network connections and air-gapped devices. Customers
              are responsible for finding and purchasing compatible
              hardware.</p>
            <p>To help simplify their approach, a new product called the Secure
              Drop Workstation is being developed and built on top of Qubes OS,
              a new security-focused desktop operating system [28]. The software
              provides functionality that compartmentalizes all of that physical
              infrastructure on a single computer. The Workstation swaps servers
              with virtual machines serving similar purposes. While more
              streamlined, Qubes OS is only compatible with limited hardware,
              which customers must also find and purchase.</p>
            <h5>Limitations</h5>
            <p>A whistleblower who uses Secure Drop faces a few obstacles.
              First, it is a Tor-only solution, which presents significant risks
              to anyone in countries where the internet is surveilled and free
              speech is limited. Recently, activists have even been arrested for
              having Tor on their mobile devices, as with Ola Bini in
              Ecuador.</p>
            <h4>Signal</h4>
            <p>Signal [26] is considered a gold standard for secure
              communication. We use it internally at Science & Design for team
              collaboration and trust it to keep confidential messages safe.
              Signal is a messaging app that is available primarily as a native
              mobile application for iOS and Android, just like WhatsApp.
              Desktop apps exist, but they require pairing with a registered
              phone. Signal is one of the few open-source apps, aside from
              Firefox and Tor, that have penetrated the public consciousness.
              Signal collaborated with WhatsApp to integrate Signal’s encryption
              protocol into WhatsApp, instantly providing strong encryption for
              billions of WhatsApp users globally. Signal is a tool many on the
              Hush Line team have contributed to.</p>
            <h5>Limitations</h5>
            <p>However, the problem arises with the lack of anonymity because in
              order to use the Signal app, one must download it from an app
              store like Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store. To do this,
              users must create an account using PII, leaking their identities
              to at least one party in the exchange. It’s commonplace for these
              companies to comply with requests from law enforcement, both
              foreign and domestic. Then, to register an account, a user needs a
              cell phone number. Acquiring a cell phone requires more PII, this
              time with your ID likely scanned to know your customer (KYC)
              regulatory requirements. This is another scenario where the
              company must comply with law enforcement requests for customer
              information. Now, at least two parties know who you are. While
              advanced workarounds exist to approximate anonymity, they are not
              doable for non-technical users or individuals without extensive
              programming skills, ultimately rendering anonymity impossible for
              the broader general public.</p>
            <h4>GlobaLeaks</h4>
            <p>GlobaLeaks [22] is a project out of Italy and is a self-hosted
              platform that’s easy to install and use. It allows a developer to
              set it up on standard hardware and provides a rich and
              customizable platform for creating forms that meet your needs.
              GlobaLeaks, because of its relative ease of installation, is one
              of the most ubiquitous tip lines used by organizations worldwide
              today. There are forks, or copies and modifications of the code,
              like AfriLeaks, that host more instances of GlobaLeaks for other
              news organizations.</p>
            <h5>Limitations</h5>
            <p>While easier than Secure Drop, GlobaLeaks still requires a
              developer and hosting your own infrastructure, making it less
              likely to be understood or used by the general public or
              individuals who do not have developer specialty knowledge. While
              the platform installs relatively simply, HTTPS is unavailable by
              default, and additional work must be done to deploy it to your
              domain name. Some users have reported issues about the platform’s
              usability, while others suffer downtime from
              misconfigurations.</p>
            <h4>Other Tools</h4>
            <p>Other tools in Table 1 include both closed-source and for-profit
              options. We believe that a tool catering to higher-risk use cases
              must be open-source and verifiable so that the public can trust
              the software to protect them to the best of its ability. One
              noteworthy closed-source option is Say Something [24], a tip line
              from the survivors of the Sandy Hook massacre focused on school
              safety and gun violence.</p>

            <h3>Threat Model</h3>
            <h4>What’s Different About Hush Line</h4>
            <p>Hush Line is unique among whistleblower products as the only
              managed service that is free and open-source. Where other models
              distribute the risk to the individual customer, we are a
              centralized service, offering some liberties and other
              constraints: We can allow anyone to create an account, but
              consistent with other tip line/whistleblower platforms, we’re also
              open to online attacks like denial of service or hacking
              attempts.</p>
            <h5>Challenges With Scale and Centralization</h5>
            <p>Because of SecureDrop’s decentralized nature — meaning there
              isn’t one central server running all of the instances — an attack
              on one server is not an attack on all. However, that means that
              when there is an attack on three to thirty servers, there are
              three to thirty servers to defend, maintain, and fix. More
              directly, there are ~70 Secure Drop instances worldwide, but only
              one instance of Hush Line, managed by Science & Design. Among
              other benefits of centralizing our services is that it allows us
              to have more users; at the end of the beta period, we had >10x
              more active instances of Secure Drop than all active instances.
              Other things Hush Line needs to consider are traffic, bad actors,
              and paying for and maintaining the app’s infrastructure.</p>

              <li>The receiver operates Hush Line in good faith.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Assumptions About the Hush Line Server</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The server is operated in good faith.</li>
              <li>The server is single-use and configured with the official
                scripts on the GitHub main repo.</li>
              <li>The server has no other software other than what is required
                for the operation of Hush Line.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Assumptions About the Source's Computer</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The computer has an updated version of a popular browser
                including Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, and for anonymous
                connections, an updated version of Tor Browser.</li>
              <li>The computer is not compromised by malware.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Assumptions About Science & Design, Inc.</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Science & Design wants to preserve the anonymity of its
                sources.</li>
              <li>Science & Design acts in the interest of allowing sources to
                submit messages, regardless of their contents.</li>
              <li>The users of the system, and those with physical access to the
                servers, can be trusted to uphold the previous assumptions
                unless the entire organization has been compromised.</li>
              <li>Science & Design is prepared to push back on any and all
                requests to compromise the integrity of the system and its
                users, including requests to deanonymize sources, block message
                submissions, or hand over encrypted or decrypted
                submissions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Assumptions About the World</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The security assumptions of `passlib` and `scrypt` with
                randomly generated salts are valid.</li>
              <li>The security/anonymity assumptions of Tor and the Onion
                service protocol are valid.</li>
              <li>The security assumptions of Hush Line dependencies,
                application packages, and application dependencies, are
                valid.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Other Assumptions or Factors</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The level of press freedom may vary in both geography and
                time.</li>
              <li>The number of daily Tor users in a country can greatly
                vary.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Threats, Failure Points, Impacts and Mitigations</h4>
            <h5>Threat: Server Compromise</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Impacts</b>: If an attacker obtains the database encryption
                key, its contents may be decrypted. Still, we do not require
                PII. If you have SMTP delivery configured, your forwarding
                address will be visible. If you haven’t added your own public
                PGP key to your account, message content will be visible.</li>
              <li><b>Mitigation</b>: Hush Line does not require PII, including
                an email address, to use the service. To protect message
                content, users are encouraged to add their own PGP key. We store
                data encrypted in our database, and do not store timestamps or
                associate member data in any way. The database key is never
                hardcoded, is isolated from both app and database environments,
                and is stored in Terraform platform environment variables,
                removing the chance of exposure to the source code.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Threat: Network Observers</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Impacts</b>: Adversaries who monitor network connections to
                our server can see your IP address and the domain you’re
                visiting.</li>
              <li><b>Mitigation</b>: All data in transit is encrypted using TLS,
                and users are encouraged to access Hush Line via Tor for
                additional anonymity. This prevents network observers from
                deciphering the content or metadata of communications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Threat: Account Compromise</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Impacts</b>: Disruption of Hush Line usage, impersonation
                which could lead to reputational harm or other damages.</li>
              <li><b>Mitigation</b>: Strong password policies, optional 2FA, and
                secure password reset mechanisms are in place to protect user
                accounts. Users are educated on best practices for maintaining
                account security.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Threat: Legal and Coercive Pressure</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Impacts</b>: Science & Design, Inc. and Hush Line must
                comply with legitimate legal requests, which could result in the
                forfeiture of data that includes your username, SMTP
                information, public PGP key, or other information you provide to
                Hush Line. No PII is required to use the Hush Line service, but
                if you’ve donated to our Open Collective or purchased anything
                from our Shopify store, potentially identifying information,
                including your shipping and billing address, name, email
                address, and IP address, could be tied back to you with
                sufficient analysis.</li>
              <li><b>Mitigation</b>: Hush Line is designed to hold minimal
                information that could be of interest in legal contexts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Failure Points</h4>
            <h5>The Human Element</h5>
            <p>The human element encompasses anything a person can touch. For
              developers, it means the code they write; for journalists, it
              means the tools they use and how they are used. Bugs are always
              part of software engineering, and we should never assume there is
              a “perfect” state of security or anonymity. If you give users a
              robust and well-considered privacy policy, we know they won’t read
              it. And it’s safe to assume that humans will look for shortcuts
              when presented with complex workflows. This includes using
              work-issued devices or networks to communicate with journalists or
              exfiltrate secret information.</p>

            <h5>Compromised Devices</h5>
            <p>The human element includes compromising devices. Few guardrails
              on Android protect users from installing malware from unknown
              sources, and even Google’s Play Store hosts applications that
              contain malware [29]. It doesn’t have to be as obvious as
              installing suspicious software from suspicious sources. It can be
              as simple as clicking a link and loading a URL, or even loading
              images in your email client [30]:</p>
            <blockquote>
              “As described in the proof-of-concept attack released by the
              researchers, the attacker uses one of the encrypted messages you
              are supposed to receive or might have already received and then
              turns it into a multipart HTML email message, as well as forges
              the return address, so it appears to come from the original
              sender.
              In the newly composed email, the attacker adds an unclosed image
              tag, like this, as clearly shown in the screenshot.
              When your vulnerable email client receives this message, it
              decrypts the encrypted part of the message given in the middle,
              and then automatically tries to render the HTML content, i.e., the
              image tag with all the decrypted text as the new name of the
              image, as shown below.
              Since your email client will try to load the image from the
              attacker-controlled server, the attacker can capture this incoming
              request, where the filename contains the full content of the
              original encrypted email in plaintext.”
            </blockquote>

            <h5>Compromised Infrastructure</h5>
            <p>Hush Line uses cloud providers to manage our application and
              database. Our distributed approach increases security by isolating
              our database from the application environment and limiting access.
              But with this convenience comes the risk of our providers
              receiving a gag order and being forced to install monitoring
              software, lest they want to face prison or time-consuming legal
              proceedings.</p>

            <h4>Hush Line’s Additional Protections</h4>
            <h5>Verification System</h5>
            <p>Hush Line employs a verification system to ensure that users can
              trust the source of communication. This system is essential for
              users who are public figures or have a broad audience. The
              verification system includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Display of Verification Status</b>: Hush Line indicates
                verified accounts with a distinctive **Verified** badge. This
                visual indicator helps users distinguish authentic accounts from
                potential impersonators, reducing the risk of phishing
                attacks.</li>
              <li><b>Data Retention</b>: The information used to verify you is
                never saved, even temporarily.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>User Education</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Encryption Indicators</b>: The platform informs users
                whether their messages will be encrypted. For accounts with a
                public PGP key, messages are encrypted, ensuring that only the
                intended recipient can decrypt and read them. This feature is
                highlighted through messages on the submission form, emphasizing
                the importance of encryption for sensitive information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>User Guidance</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Informative Messages for Senders and Receivers</b>: Hush
                Line educates its users about the significance of encryption and
                the steps required to ensure message confidentiality. This
                includes prompts for receivers to add a public PGP key if they
                haven’t already, and notifications for senders about the
                encryption status of their message.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div id="Overview" class="tabcontent" style="display:none;">
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>Hush Line addresses the problems we've observed across different
              industries: high costs and usability challenges of existing
              solutions, shrinking budgets in newsrooms, classrooms, and
              workplaces, and the absence of an open-source managed service
              operated by a non-profit.</p>
            <p>The threats vary in severity, but the needs across job roles and
              use cases are similar. Whether nation-states or neighborhood
              watches, individuals need a highly available, usable, and
              affordable product. Most people needing confidential reporting are
              busy and don't have the time to adopt a new workflow or learn new
              technology. When a whistleblower decides to talk to a lawyer or
              journalist, they're vulnerable and likely have already faced
              retaliation. Hush Line removes all technical hurdles from people
              who need help by offering a platform that is accessible with the
              software already on your phone or computer.</p>
            <p>We use widely adopted, time-tested standards and protocols,
              allowing for greater interoperability with popular tools like
              Proton Mail and Mailvelope. We designed Hush Line to shine as a
              background service - understanding that many people have
              app-overload and adding anything new is a big request. Hush Line
              forwards encrypted messages to your email inbox, ensuring you
              never miss an important tip.</p>

            <h4>System Requirements</h4>
            <p>We built Hush Line as a managed service designed for high
              availability, usability, and security. While Hush Line is intended
              for users to create an account on `hushline.app`, we encourage
              people and organizations to self-host if they prefer. For
              consistent implementation, we provide full documentation on
              getting it started for your organization.</p>

            <h5>Architecture</h5>
            <img src="assets/img/architecture.png" alt="System Requirements">

            <h5>Hush Line Technical Architecture</h5>
            <p>We use a combination of Digital Ocean, Terraform, and GitHub to
              automate our build and release pipeline and disposable development
              environments.</p>

            <h5>Database Isolation</h5>
            <p>To help defend against database compromise, we isolate resources,
              as seen in Diagram 1. In the event that the application server
              becomes compromised, lateral movement to the database is not
              possible. We use TLS encryption for connections to and from the
              database and restrict access to application and bastion
              servers.</p>

            <h5>Bastion Server</h5>
            <p>The only way to access the database is through a Bastion server —
              an isolated server that infrastructure owners SSH into and then
              connect to the database. Access to the Bastion server is
              restricted to relevant technical staff, and SSH is completely
              disabled to the database server.</p>

            <h5>Mail Forwarding</h5>
            <p>Email forwarding is a convenient and user-friendly feature. Our
              integration of Mailgun allows a tip line owner to enter their
              email address, and forwarding will work. Alternatively, a user may
              use a custom SMTP provider or have no SMTP forwarding at all.
              Custom configurations mean end users must have technical
              proficiency in finding their SMTP server, port, username, and
              password if their email provider supports it.</p>

            <h5>Onion Services</h5>
            <p>We use Onion Services for users with advanced privacy needs. An
              Onion Service issues our app and website a `.onion` address,
              making it accessible anonymously using the Tor Browser. Onion
              Services bypass DNS by never exiting the Tor Network to reach its
              destination. Our Onion Services are run in isolated containers for
              increased security.</p>

            <h5>Managed Services</h5>
            <p>Using managed services always comes with tradeoffs. On one hand,
              they add a layer of risk by trusting a third party. On the other
              hand, they allow us to minimize risk by offloading server and
              database maintenance. Hush Line addresses this by requiring a PGP
              key to enable email forwarding and ensuring plaintext messages are
              never shared outside of our hosting platform, Digital Ocean, in
              our case.</p>

            <h5>Product Design</h5>
            <p>Whistleblowing is a scary, unfamiliar process, and the software
              you use should be disarming while doing all it can to keep you
              safe. We’re a text-only service and encourage users to begin with
              a plan rather than grabbing and dumping loads of information. We
              think that through guidance and education, users can keep
              themselves safe while engaging in responsible disclosure.</p>

            <h5>Interface Design</h5>
            <p>The application’s UI leans into conversational conventions with a
              sense of levity, using emoji throughout the interface text. It
              tries not to rush the user but rather present information in a
              friendly way that helps educate the whistleblower while
              maintaining a high standard for usability.</p>

            <h5>Interaction Design</h5>
            <p>Perhaps what differentiates Hush Line the most is that we’re a
              centralized service. Rather than depending on individual
              self-hosters to configure their own instances correctly, we manage
              all of the services, so users don’t have to worry about
              specialized tech and can instead focus on their work.</p>
            <p>Like any modern web service, including Instagram, Google, or
              Signal, a user may go to the Hush Line app and create an account
              to use the platform. In a Settings panel, individuals can add
              their own PGP key, set up email forwarding, add a display name, or
              enable two-factor authentication.</p>

            <h5>Accessibility</h5>
            <p>Hush Line received a service grant from Open Tech Fund in the
              form of an accessibility audit. The audit’s goals were to make the
              screen-reader experience usable, descriptive, and intentional.</p>

            <h5>To CAPTCHA?</h5>
            <p>Throughout the beta period, users received spam messages. Since
              messages can be end-to-end encrypted, combined with using custom
              SMTP settings, client-side filtering is an imperfect solution.</p>

            <h6>hCaptcha</h6>
            <p>An analysis of an hCaptcha integration showed multiple external
              site connections, increasing IP leakage just to send a message.
              There are also security tradeoffs since “it loads
              `https://newassets.hcaptcha.com//captcha/v1/988e468/hcaptcha.js`
              along with multiple other javascript source files, and it executes
              them in the browser.” [31]</p>

            <h6>Local Captcha</h6>
            <p>We explored CAPTCHA options including creating an image with
              letters and numbers obstructed by randomly drawn lines and
              presenting a basic math problem. Using an image was a blocker due
              to accessibility limitations: a bling user won’t be able to read
              the image, even with assistive technology, and therefore wouldn’t
              be able to submit a message. A math problem, while not perfect,
              only needs to catch most bots, and since it’s an accessible
              solution, it was our best option.</p>

              <h4>Making PGP Slightly Easier</h4>
              <h5>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)</h5>
              <p>PGP works using public/private key encryption. Think of your
                public key as envelopes made just for you and the private key as
                a special letter opener, the only thing in the world that can
                open those envelopes.</p>
              <p>Most of the time, PGP works by two people individually,
                creating a public/private key pair. They first exchange public
                keys and may begin sending encrypted messages. Only the sender
                and receiver’s private keys, which are never shared with anyone,
                can decrypt the messages.</p>
              <h6>Proton</h6>
              <p>We recommend using Hush Line in conjunction with Proton. Proton
                provides encrypted productivity tools, with Proton Mail being
                their flagship application. Proton Mail is an email provider
                like Gmail, but it is encrypted, so only you can read its
                contents, not the company or even an attacker with access to its
                servers. Like Hush Line, Proton uses PGP for message encryption,
                so a user may download a copy of their Proton public PGP key in
                Mail settings. A user adds that key to their Hush Line settings,
                and also adds their Proton Mail address for email forwarding,
                and now any tips submitted to your Hush Line will be delivered
                to Proton, and since you have the private key already there,
                they’ll automatically be decrypted for you!</p>
              <h6>Mailvelope</h6>
              <p>For users of other email services, including Gmail, we’ve
                integrated Mailvelope, a powerful browser extension that enables
                PGP encryption and decryption directly in the browser. Users may
                install the Mailvelope browser extension on Chrome or Firefox,
                and once configured, can read decoded messages without any other
                application.</p>

              <h4>Limitations</h4>
              <h5>Money</h5>
              <p>Scale and money are the main limiters for a web application.
                Currently, at ~$1,500/yr, it’s a manageable number, even if the
                hosting organization took it on entirely. However, as we scale,
                costs may significantly increase to more than is sustainable
                without a financial model to support the service.</p>

              <h5>User Error</h5>
              <p>We also cannot account for the operational security or online
                behavior of individuals using our platform. For example, if a
                whistleblower uses a compromised device to record their screen,
                Hush Line cannot protect their communications.</p>

              <h5>Governments</h5>
              <p>Our services are hosted in the United States, which has
                National Security laws that may force a provider, including us,
                to remain silent about orders received. This means that if
                Digital Ocean received an order to monitor Hush Line’s servers,
                they may not be allowed to tell us about it. This is why we
                encourage all users to add a PGP key to their account.</p>

              <h5>Developer Error</h5>
              <p>Humans will make errors. Even the developers of Hush Line,
                despite their expertise, are still prone to errors. Hush Line is
                proudly open source, and we encourage the community of users,
                hackers, security researchers, and others to find ways to
                improve.</p>

              <h3>Personal Server</h3>
              <p>As we’ve seen, the convenience of centralized web applications
                provides opportunities for high availability, scalability, and
                usability, we know that sometimes a user’s threat models include
                not trusting any third parties. In this situation, we offer the
                Hush Line Personal Server. It hosts the entire Hush Line
                platform on a self-hosted device. We designed a custom case
                milled from solid aircraft-grade aluminum that physically closes
                access to all ports except power and ethernet, making it
                resistant to Evil Maid attacks. Additionally, we disable SSH,
                USB, and Wifi on the device. A user boots it up, and an e-paper
                display will show a QR code with the address to their Hush Line
                Onion Service instance.</p>

              <h4>System Requirements</h4>
              <p>The Personal Server is designed to be deployable to hardware
                with limited resources, specifically the Raspberry Pi. It uses a
                pre-built image and Docker to containerize the app, onion
                service, and database. The Personal Server is a consumer device
                that packages a Raspberry Pi 4 with 1 GB RAM, an e-paper
                display, and a custom, security-focused case.</p>

              <h4>Architecture</h4>
              <p>Everything runs locally on the Personal Server. Using Ansible
                to deploy and Docker to run the application makes it easy to
                replicate builds and ensure consistency (Figure 5). In place of
                a managed database, we use `sqlite3` locally, and instead of
                using RiseUp for email forwarding, SMTP relies on custom
                configurations set by users.</p>

              <h5>Unique Identification</h5>
              <p>The only access to the device is by removing the lid, and to
                help defend against physical access, uniquely numbered,
                tamper-evident tags seal the lid to the body. Personal Server
                owners are encouraged to copy their cover numbers down; if
                tampering is ever suspected, they may verify that they
                match.</p>
              <h5>Custom Case</h5>
              <p>We designed custom cases milled from solid A606 alloy. All
                ports, except for power and ethernet, are sealed from physical
                access. The lid is a 5mm piece of smoked acrylic, giving a clear
                view of the e-paper display, which shows a QR code embedded with
                the device’s onion address.</p>
              <p>Everything is plug-and-play; the owner needs no specialized
                training to set up and operate the Personal Server. Our custom
                cases are not for sale individually; we are exclusive
                distributors.</p>
              <h5>Ethical Monetization</h5>
              <p>Hush Line is proudly supported by the Data Empowerment Fund,
                but Science & Design, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) and, as a non-profit,
                receives most financing through grant cycles that are both
                inconsistent and insufficient. Understanding the cost associated
                with web services, Science & Design understands the need to seek
                product sustainability through financial sustainability. We are
                seeking a path toward ethical monetization through paid tiers of
                features targeted at business users. We will always provide our
                core services for free, and will continue researching how to
                make Hush Line more valuable for paying customers while
                maintaining our non-profit principles.</p>

                <h3>The Path to Launch</h3>
                <h4>Pre-Release Beta</h4>
                <p>Before asking funders for support, having a minimum-viable
                  product was an important milestone. To understand how we could
                  improve the service, we ran a six-month beta program. During
                  that time, we interviewed participants who included former
                  whistleblowers, journalists, researchers, and others.</p>
                <h4>Feedback & Findings</h4>
                <p><b>PGP Key Length</b>: Depending on the encryption algorithm
                  and other factors, PGP keys can differ in length
                  significantly. Quickly after kicking off the beta, a
                  participant tried using a key greater than 10,000 characters
                  long an was unable to.</p>
                <p><b>User Directory</b>: After suggestions from one of our
                  subject matter experts, Dr. Martin Shelton, we included an
                  opt-in user directory. This allows whistleblowers to find who
                  they need in a centralized place without hunting around the
                  Internet.</p>
                <p><b>Bios</b>: One prominent whistleblower suggested adding
                  additional social proof, including a bio for the
                  whistleblower: “Making sure the whistleblower can confirm at
                  each step that they’re talking to the right person is
                  incredibly important for the person’s safety.”</p>
                <p><b>Better Message Forwarding</b>: During the beta, we leaned
                  on manual SMTP configuration, asking users to add their SMTP
                  username, password, port, and server. A query at the end of
                  the beta period showed that only 1.35% of participants
                  configured message forwarding.</p>
                <p><b>Beta Numbers</b></h4>
                  <p>Enrollment numbers for features like two-factor
                    authentication appear low but are actually consistent with
                    what we see with major platforms like Twitter, where the 2FA
                    enrollment was 2.5%, slightly lower than Hush Line’s
                    beta.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Total Testers</b>: 815</li>
                    <li><b>2FA Enrolled</b>: 3.07%</li>
                    <li><b>PGP Enabled</b>: 2.82%</li>
                    <li><b>SMTP Enabled</b>: 1.35%</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Our First Grant</h3>
                  <p>Hush Line was awarded a $100,000 grant from the Data
                    Empowerment Fund to bring the app from prototype to
                    production. We hired our first engineers, including Micah
                    Lee, the creator of OnionShare, and core Tor Project and
                    SecureDrop developer.</p>
                  <h4>Tentative Grant Budget</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Engineering @ 65%</b>: Infrastructure development,
                      front and back-end engineering, accessibility, and
                      cryptography.</li>
                    <li><b>Infrastructure @ 10%</b>: Costs for hosting on
                      various platforms.</li>
                    <li><b>Product Management @ 15%</b>: Roadmap, UX, UXR,
                      Project Management.</li>
                    <li><b>Org Admin @ 10%</b>: Lights-on fee.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Grant Application</h3>
                  <p>As a new 501(c)(3) non-profit starting from scratch, both
                    financially and from a product perspective, we can
                    confidently say that finding funding is not a trivial
                    pursuit. Unlike businesses in the for-profit sector, VCs do
                    not give millions to non-profits that cannot potentially
                    return a massive profit on their investment.
                    What does that mean for social entrepreneurs who are
                    passionate about change? How do we get started and encourage
                    more to join the fight for more ethical software? To help
                    provide a guide for future creators, we’re including the
                    questions and answers from our successful grant application
                    below.</p>
                  <h4>Questions & Answers</h4>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Describe the problem you are working to solve, or your
                      diagnosis of the status quo and why it must be
                      changed.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>In the workplace, up to 90% of women in some
                        industries experience sexual assault and harassment. 61%
                        of employees will witness or experience workplace
                        harassment or discrimination. Only 18 out of 100 people
                        will ever make a formal complaint, and fewer than 1%
                        will find a resolution in court. Fear of retaliation
                        causes this massive gap in reporting, but people want to
                        help; they just can’t always take on the risks of public
                        involvement. This problem has started to gain
                        legislative support, with the EU Whistleblower Directive
                        of 2019 coming into effect in 2023. Now, employers must
                        offer confidential ways through internal and external
                        channels if they have more than 50 employees.<br><br>

                        For newsrooms, budget cuts, and layoffs force
                        organizations to consider new publishing methods.
                        Vice.com and Jezabel shuttering are two recent examples,
                        but a more holistic view shows that from 2008 through
                        2020, there’s been a 25% decrease in headcount. When
                        approached to adopt whistleblowing tools, the first
                        question many ask is, “Who will manage it?” The tools on
                        the market currently include the robust but
                        prohibitively difficult-to-set-up SecureDrop, and
                        GlobalLeaks, a self-hosted tool requiring technical
                        proficiency to configure and manage.<br><br>

                        And in schools, especially in the US, gun violence is an
                        unfortunate reality that students have to live with.
                        When we conducted research with students in West
                        Oakland, we learned that students would speak up if they
                        knew something, but if their “lives will be ruined” by
                        being “labeled as a snitch,” they’ll keep quiet. Coupled
                        with budgets so low that many educators have to buy
                        their own markers, a technical solution for school
                        safety isn’t always practical.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Describe how your initiative is designed to address this
                      problem or bring about this change.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Currently, no free and open-source managed tip line
                        services are on the market, and this is what Science &
                        Design is excited to bring to the market through Hush
                        Line. We’ll soon launch a platform that makes it easy
                        for anyone to create an account and have a lightweight,
                        secure, and anonymous tip line for free. For the highest
                        threat models and those requiring complete control of
                        their infrastructure, we have a hardware product called
                        the Personal Server, which is designed to be the most
                        secure way to run Hush Line. Or, if a user or
                        organization prefers, they can host the platform on
                        their own infrastructure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Tell us about the composition, experience and diversity
                      of your team. Also list any other organisations who would
                      be involved in your initiative, such as delivery partners
                      or advisors.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Two of our members, Glenn Sorrentino and Micah Lee,
                        both on the Science & Design Board of Directors, serve
                        on the Board of Advisors for Distributed Denial of
                        Secrets, a 501(c)(3) archiving and publishing hacked and
                        leaked datasets serving the public interest.<br><br>

                        Science & Design is led by Glenn Sorrentino, a product
                        designer and researcher with a long history of
                        demonstrated impact by delivering core features and
                        functionality for Salesforce, including Search, Voice,
                        Identity, Authentication, and other platform tools still
                        in use. He’s been awarded multiple US patents for his
                        work and has led the design of high-profile products
                        that have been the focus of keynotes at the annual
                        Dreamforce conference, which attracts more than 100k
                        customers. And as a former military whistleblower, he
                        has personal experience speaking up.<br><br>

                        Our contributors include active journalists, members of
                        the core team of OnionShare and Dangerzone, SMEs and
                        researchers from Freedom of the Press Foundation, and
                        individuals who have worked on tools like SecureDrop,
                        Tor, and Signal.<br><br>

                        We’re driven by a passion to bring usable, accessible,
                        secure, and private products that add real value to
                        people who need them most.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Describe the maturity of your initiative.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Our first version of the app, a purely self-hosted,
                        ultra-minimal version, was soft-launched at DEFCON 31 to
                        a very successful reception. A few months before that,
                        we applied for an independent security audit. We then
                        started working on the Personal Server and a managed
                        service. Those products were included in the security
                        audit, which is currently wrapping up. We’re waiting for
                        a public GA launch until we can address the report’s
                        findings and anticipate finishing in early Q2.<br><br>

                        We currently have a private beta online where people can
                        request an invite to test the app. We’re limiting
                        signups to a small group of users to conduct qualitative
                        research to learn how the service might improve ahead of
                        our GA launch.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>What value of grant are you seeking from the Data
                      Empowerment Fund?</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>$100,000</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Describe what activities you would use the grant to
                      undertake.</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>As we prepare for launch, we must consider
                        infrastructure needs for scaling our service and,
                        perhaps most importantly, mitigations for DOS attacks
                        since we’ll have journalists and other at-risk groups as
                        users.<br>

                        Other areas to investigate:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Integrating the Signal protocol for email and
                            PGP-free service.</li>
                          <li>Native mobile apps for browser-free

                            including I2P or Snowstorm.</li>
                          <li>Code rewrite in a memory-safe language such as
                            RUST.</li>
                        </ul>

                      <li>Describe what outputs you would use the grant to
                        produce. These are the things your activities will
                        produce.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The output of our activities will come with
                          significant benefits to our product, including:</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>More resilient infrastructure to attack.</li>
                          <li>More reliable service for users experiencing
                            censored internet connections.</li>
                          <li>More flexible service through Signal
                            integration.</li>
                          <li>Delivery of native iOS, Android, and F-Droid apps
                            that can help extend our reach to users who might
                            only have mobile connectivity.</li>
                          <li>Future-proofed codebase with a rewrite in a
                            memory-safe language.</li>
                          <li>Improved service for users experiencing internet
                            outages.</li>
                          <li>New features tailored for expanded organizational
                            needs.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Describe what outcomes you would use the grant to
                        achieve.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The first goal of Hush Line is to foster more trust
                          in communities by offering safe ways to engage with
                          people who can influence meaningful change. Will
                          sources be more encouraged to speak up if they have a
                          no-strings-attached way of sharing information with
                          journalists? Can workplaces be safer if employees have
                          a retaliation-proof way to report ethical or legal
                          violations? And can schools be safer by giving
                          students a trustworthy way to share information with a
                          trusted educator?<br><br>

                          The data tells us that people will help if they know
                          they’ll be protected. Hush Line hopes to fill this gap
                          with our product suite, which is designed to fit any
                          threat model.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Describe the ultimate impact you would use the grant
                        to achieve.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>We want to see Hush Line become ubiquitous in
                          newsrooms, workplaces, and schoolhouses.<br><br>

                          One key metric for success will be not only our total
                          number of users but also how many verified users we
                          have. We offer a verification program so that
                          community members can know the authenticity of an
                          account. Once an individual or organization completes
                          the verification process, their message submission
                          page will display a Verified badge, helping anyone
                          have confidence that their message is going to the
                          intended recipient.<br><br>

                          Verification is only offered to journalists,
                          newsrooms, educators, public figures, activists, and
                          organizations.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>What will others be able to learn from your
                        initiative?</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>We’re particularly interested in supporting
                          initiatives that: have significant public policy
                          relevance; enable people to control how data is used
                          to train AI models; and/or involve a novel legal,
                          technological or participatory approach.<br><br>

                          Hush Line aims to solve not only user problems but
                          also business problems. We want to encourage community
                          involvement and participatory change-making through
                          providing trustworthy, easy-to-use software.<br><br>

                          For business, we want to address organizational and
                          product sustainability through our platform. Funding
                          is challenging and uncertain. Because of this, many
                          projects either go unfunded or need help to maintain
                          and have to lean on volunteers to maintain
                          velocity.<br><br>

                          We’re excited to be the first free and open-source
                          managed tip line service with a paid tier that
                          includes features more tailored to organizational
                          needs. Through exploring ethical ways of monetization,
                          we hope that Hush Line can serve as a vehicle for
                          financial sustainability, allowing us to maintain and
                          evolve the product autonomously and ensuring our
                          product and organization’s long-term success.<br><br>

                          But we’re not reserving monetization only for us. If
                          an organization chooses, they can host the managed
                          Hush Line service on their own infrastructure and
                          either unlock all paid features for free or integrate
                          their own Stripe credentials to bootstrap their own
                          micro-economy.<br><br>

                          We believe that more 501(c)(3) organizations, like
                          Science & Design, should offer reliable and
                          trustworthy software infrastructure to help protect
                          user data from being sold to data brokers and protect
                          platforms against company takeover and shutdowns. A
                          recent example is that of Skiff, a productivity
                          platform whose value proposition was offering

                          recently acquired and shut down by Notion, leaving
                          their users, who included journalists and human rights
                          defenders, in search of a new place to move their
                          data. Since non-profits can’t be acquired, this can be
                          a meaningful way to ensure the stability and longevity
                          of open-source platforms.</li>

                          so much we need to learn. We want to network with
                          other professionals and organizations and understand
                          how to improve the product to serve more users and use
                          cases. We’re also aware that our ethical monetization
                          model is relatively new for FOSS software — we want to
                          refine it into something that serves not only as a
                          roadmap for others to emulate but one that the
                          collective input of the broader community can
                          shape.</li>
