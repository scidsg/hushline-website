<p>[This article is a draft and subject to update.] It's tough out there. Grants seem harder and harder to come by, and the cost of maintaining software services is ongoing. We were honored to receive a grant from the Data Empowerment Fund for $100k; it enabled us to reach a stable, robust, production-ready state, enabling our first paying customers and many more free users. But another grant we were crossing our fingers for fell through, and it's a reminder that this cannot be our primary funding source for stable, long-term infrastructure.</p>
<p>This realization is not new - I understood the scarcity of funding compared to the for-profit world. It was a lesson learned quickly, and as someone with a career as a product designer, SaaS seemed like an obvious solution to a ubiquitous problem in my new industry. This is not only an obvious solution but also one with a significant monetary upside that, and combined with our 501(c)(3) structure, offers a compelling model for self-sustainability and community empowerment.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-consumer-non-profit-software-landscape">The Consumer Non-Profit Software Landscape<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/hushline-sustainable-model#the-consumer-non-profit-software-landscape" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Consumer Non-Profit Software Landscape" title="Direct link to The Consumer Non-Profit Software Landscape">​</a></h2>
<p>If you work outside the tech or tech-adjacent industries, you'll be hard-pressed to name a single non-profit or open-source piece of software, let alone one you use. You'll probably be able to name a lot of consumer alternatives - Google, Apple, Dropbox, Outlook, Slack - though all of these use open-source software to drive their closed-source development, their model is to charge a lot, make it expensive to leave, and lock you into a system to which you become dependent. The astronomical profits these companies make create new record levels of wealth inequality that allow Big Tech CEOs to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/28/1232564250/billionaire-benioff-buys-hawaii-land-salesforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">displace communities and businesses for their private use</a>. At the same time, the dream of home ownership is a fading reality for most people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hawaii has long been a place where the world's elite has flocked. And tech billionaires are now among the newest cadre of migrants to buy land in the islands. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns a sprawling beach mansion in Maui. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has plans to build a bunker on his land in Kauai, according to Wired. Benioff's former boss, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, owns 98% of Lanai. And the list goes on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What's different here is that rather than focusing on coastal mansions in gated communities, Benioff is buying property in a rural residential town. In the majority of instances, he's paid more than current market value, according to public records. For example, the longtime Mamane Bakery — known for its lilikoi cheesecake and mango-guava hot cross buns — shuttered after he purchased the land for more than 50% above the current market value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most important part is that the upside for making money is so great that a successful application of it in the non-profit sector could create generational, self-funded charities that are legally required to do good. What if instead of buying for-profit, billionaire-making CRM software, you had an alternative whose profits went to reforming corruption in business? Instead of fighting for $100,000, what if an organization could organically make 100x that and give a large portion away?</p>
<p>This is our opportunity with Hush Line. Anonymous reporting is a cross-industry need, legally mandated in some sectors and countries. Open-source software is our development model, enabling community review of our source code and other organizations and individuals to use our software for free. Even though anyone can install our platform themselves, we understand that most people and organizations are non-technical and cannot operate and maintain their own software infrastructure. Additionally, if you're buying security software, it's imperative to know that the code treats your data the way the makers say it is.</p>

<p>If you visit hushline.app to create an account, you're using our software as a service (SaaS) platform. A free tier offers most people everything they need for a secure, anonymous tip line. We have a low-cost paid tier or licensed managed single-tenant instances for businesses or professionals who require more features. For high-risk tip line owners who do not want to trust any third-party services, we offer a hardware device that runs Hush Line locally as an Onion Service. For developers, hobbyists, or businesses with technical proficiency, anyone can freely install and use all of Hush Line's features.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="paas">PaaS<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/hushline-sustainable-model#paas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PaaS" title="Direct link to PaaS">​</a></h3>
<p>Some organizations may want their own independent app and infrastructure instead of using <code>hushline.app</code>. In this case, we offer managed single-tenant instances that are perfect for all sizes of business.</p>

<p>Higher security and anonymity are critical for their work for a smaller audience—human rights defenders, investigative journalists, or high-profile lawyers. We offer devices for $500 that are fully self-contained, Tor-only Hush Line instances. If your threat model is one in which you cannot trust any third-party infrastructure, this is your best option.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-opportunity">The Opportunity<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/hushline-sustainable-model#the-opportunity" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Opportunity" title="Direct link to The Opportunity">​</a></h2>
<p>If successful, the market opportunity will be <a href="https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/whistleblowing-software-market-4595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$238m in 2025, growing to over $300m in 2032</a>. Even on the very low end, becoming profitable is possible. It only takes about $3,000 to operate Hush Line's software annually. Once we surpass the point of platform financial stability, we will have money that will go toward more than making a few people rich.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whistleblower-fund">Whistleblower Fund<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/hushline-sustainable-model#whistleblower-fund" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Whistleblower Fund" title="Direct link to Whistleblower Fund">​</a></h2>
<p>As with any charitable cause, people are the point, and the folks we're helping are whistleblowers. These individuals often lose their careers and life savings and can suffer from significant mental health issues. To address this, we're starting a new whistleblower fund that will be its own independent non-profit, governed by former whistleblowers, whistleblower lawyers, and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fund will directly support whistleblowers' pragmatic needs, with a small portion reserved for the development and maintenance of the Hush Line platform. If we chose a 70/30 distribution model, we would need recurring $1,000/mo donations, combined with sales, to "keep the lights on."</p>
<p>Ideally, we could afford ~10 hours/mo for an engineering contractor, around $2,000. To get to this amount, we'd need to raise or earn around $7,500/mo with the same 70/30 distribution for Hush Line to earn enough to cover everything needed. Eventually, as the fund grew in popularity, we could even sustain a full-time team.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="obstacles">Obstacles<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/hushline-sustainable-model#obstacles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Obstacles" title="Direct link to Obstacles">​</a></h2>
<p>While it seems straightforward, we face significant obstacles. The new organization governing the fund still needs to be formed. Will a 501(c)(3) be approved that explicitly supports whistleblowers? Federal staff have been laid off in record numbers, and the regulatory situation in the US government is tenuous at best.</p>
<p>Adoption is the largest barrier to success. While we don't need much, we're the new kid on the block, and as a non-profit with exactly $0 for advertising or sales as of writing this, it's a slow game. Large non-profits like Wikimedia, Signal, or Tor have a large and loyal donor-base. We're entering the industry during difficult economic and political times, and asking working people for their limited funds is a delicate thing.</p>
<p>There always seems to be more than one top priority when building software, but security is among the most important. Offering a centralized service makes you a target, and if we ever experience a data breach, it could cause significant reputational damage. Security is a moving target requiring constant vigilance and proactivity. Our engineering team is made up of security experts and industry leaders, but nothing is perfectly secure, and people are fallible.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-we-get-there">How We Get There<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/hushline-sustainable-model#how-we-get-there" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How We Get There" title="Direct link to How We Get There">​</a></h2>
<p>This year, we'll start the formation of the new fund and assemble a governing board that will ensure the funds are used as stated in our mission goals.</p>
<p>The individuals who oversee the fund will have a first-hand understanding of the battles people who speak up face: whistleblower lawyers, former whistleblowers, journalists, or others who support the needs of people engaging in responsible disclosure.</p>
<p>Do you know someone who should be on the Board? <a href="https://tips.hushline.app/to/glenn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reach out to me on Hush Line</a>!</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encryption settings wireframe]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Encryption settings wireframe" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/cover-83ebca78119ff8ea946e2149fb19954e.png" width="1186" height="464" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Hush Line is a general-purpose anonymous reporting tool that can be used across a range of industries. In this article, we'll explore how journalists and newsrooms can quickly get started with a Hush Line account that'll enable anyone with an internet connection to reach you without downloading a new app or creating an account.</p>
<p>I've been working on private messengers for a while. In 2016, I worked on Signal's first desktop app redesign. Around the same time, I started working on OnionShare. This peer-to-peer file transfer tool uses the Tor Network to create ephemeral anonymous connections for leaking sources to journalists. The work led me to contribute to CalyxOS, a de-Googled Android OS, for a few years and eventually join the Board of Advisors for Distributed Denial of Secrets. This non-profit publishes and archives public interest hacked and leaked documents.</p>
<p>I love usability. My career has been as a product designer and user researcher for a Big Tech enterprise organization, where I worked on many exciting projects, including search, identity and authentication, voice, and more. But my passion for public interest work outweighed enterprise software, and I left to start Science &amp; Design and then create our first product, Hush Line.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-hush-line">What is Hush Line?<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/newsrooms-and-journalists#what-is-hush-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Hush Line?" title="Direct link to What is Hush Line?">​</a></h2>
<p>Hush Line is a SaaS (software as a service) platform where anyone who needs a tip line can easily sign up for free. We already have journalists from ABC News, Mother Jones, Reveal, BBC, and more, and the service enables anyone in the public to reach them anonymously. Communications are end-to-end encrypted, and whistleblowers do not need to create an account or download any apps, including Tor Browser, in order to send a secure and private message that only the tip line owner can read.</p>
<p>We're different from other tools familiar to journalists, including SecureDrop and GlobaLeaks, because these options are self-hosted, meaning you need to run your own software or hardware infrastructure to use them. Conversely, Hush Line enables anyone to sign up for an account on a centralized service, eliminating the need for self-hosting. We're also free. Other solutions mean paying developers, buying specialized hardware, training staff, and following prescriptive workflows.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-use-hush-line">How to Use Hush Line<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/newsrooms-and-journalists#how-to-use-hush-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Use Hush Line" title="Direct link to How to Use Hush Line">​</a></h2>
<p>After signing up, you only need to add an encryption key to start receiving messages. If you use Proton Mail, it's as simple as entering your Proton address, and we'll import your public key into Hush Line! Now, when you receive rich notifications back to that same email address, your tips will seamlessly and automatically be decrypted in your inbox!</p>

<p>Include a descriptive bio and additional links in your profile details that point to your profiles on your newsroom websites, personal social media accounts, Signal username, or anything else that'll act as social proofs to help your community confirm authenticity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Profile Settings" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/settings-52bca3e9975b743f52a009d2684272fd.png" width="2648" height="1844" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Adding a self-authenticating or verified URL is easy and helps us fast-track your account verification process. Just add a link to your Hush Line profile on your website, and include&nbsp;rel="me"&nbsp;in the anchor tag. Then, add your website to your profile details on Hush Line, and you'll see a checkmark appear.&nbsp;<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a full tutorial on adding verified URLs</a>.</p>

<p>We offer free verified accounts to journalists and newsrooms. Once your account is ready, send a message to the <a href="https://tips.hushline.app/to/admin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hush Line Admin account</a>, including your Hush Line profile and a way to contact you if it's not already in your profile details.</p>

<p>In order for people to know they can send you messages on Hush Line, they have to know you use it! The easiest and best way to share your tip line to ensure plausible deniability for sources is to share widely. Add a link to your Hush Line profile on your social media accounts, in your email signature, on your personal and professional websites, or anywhere else someone might go to attempt to contact you.</p>
<p>We already have received reports that users have received helpful messages from places with censored internet access.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I started contributing to OnionShare because I found Micah Lee's Signal contact on his Twitter bio and reached out, and we've continued collaborating on it for years. With Hush Line, the person sending a message doesn't need to be a user of the platform or download an app, as in the case with Signal.</p>
<p><a href="https://tips.hushline.app/to/phocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Byrd</a>, a journalist at ABC News, adds a link to his Hush Line account on his Mastodon profile:</p>

<p>One of Hush Line's strengths is offering free Verified badges to tip line owners who want to prevent phishing attacks by adding an additional measure of authenticity to their accounts...</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-link-to-your-hush-line-account">Step 1: Link To Your Hush Line Account<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line#step-1-link-to-your-hush-line-account" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Link To Your Hush Line Account" title="Direct link to Step 1: Link To Your Hush Line Account">​</a></h2>
<p>On a website that you own, or if you're a legal representative of a business on a site you have control of, add a link to your Hush Line profile. It can be located anywhere, but must include <code>rel="me"</code> in the link. For example:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&lt;a href="https://tips.hushline.app/to/myaccount" rel="me"&gt;Message me on Hush Line&lt;/a&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Note that your link doesn't have to say <code>Message me on Hush Line</code>, it just must contain <code>rel="me"</code> and point to your profile.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-2-update-your-bio">Step 2: Update Your Bio<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line#step-2-update-your-bio" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Update Your Bio" title="Direct link to Step 2: Update Your Bio">​</a></h2>
<p>In your Hush Line settings, from the <code>Profile</code> tab, scroll to find <code>Profile Details</code>. You'll see four fields in which you can add any information that helps your community trust that your profile belongs to you. One of those fields should be to the website whose link you just added to your Hush Line address.</p>
<p>When you click <code>Update Bio</code> we will automatically verify that the code from Step 1 exists, and you'll see a new checkmark!</p>

<p>I love Signal. I was almost their first full-time designer when the team was only four people with a physical office back in the Mission in San Francisco. I turned the offer down because I was too junior in my career to feel like I could be as effective as I knew I could be with more time at the Big Tech company I worked for...</p>
<p>...I volunteered, rejecting even being paid for my time since I had a job that paid enough. And I personally use Signal almost exclusively, so there’s no shade when I say emphatically (especially looking at you, journalists), “Signal is not enough!” Below, we’ll look at internet and messaging usage data in the United States to inform a data-informed tip line strategy.</p>

<p>There’s a particular bias against anything but Signal if you’re a journalist in the US, but this bias seriously hurts your potential impact. When I worked with the team, adoption was one of the biggest problems to solve as they were hovering around 100K users, even with the stamp of approval from Snowden. Now, the app has had a nearly 700x increase in users at around 70M globally! It’s excellent news for the team at Signal — a foundation was created (just for Signal), a billionaire is their chairman, and their future is all but guaranteed.</p>

Signal Users Globally from 2019–2024
However the total number of internet users in 2025 is ~5.5B worldwide, and Signal is but ~1.3% of that total share.</p>

Total Internet and Social Users in 2025
Okay, so Signal might have a modest share of the total pie, but people in the US must get it, right? Looking at the top messaging apps, it doesn’t seem so. In fact, Signal isn’t in the top 10.</p>

Top Messaging Apps in the United States
Here’s a personal story that I think about all the time. When I was working with the team, Moxie traveled down to Menlo Park to personally work with the WhatsApp team to integrate the Signal Protocol. It was a normal, slow morning when he said that it was done and deployed, almost as an “oh, by the way,” kind of thing, and it was at that moment, my mind exploded. Just like that, 1,000,000,000 (one billion) WhatsApp users worldwide had the strongest encryption on the market. Now, it’s used by two of the top four most-used messaging apps in the world, so by all counts, the scale of their positive impact deserves a Nobel Prize, in my opinion. Having said that, Signal itself isn’t among the top 10 most used apps in the United States.
A more recent story: I was visiting one of my besties, whose son I’m the godfather of, who is now 19 years old and studying cybersecurity. Since my career has been in software, and most recently in the security and privacy space, I was eager to introduce him to influential people I know and to try to give him real-world experience, maybe with work on Hush Line. “If I’m going to intro you to ppl, let’s move to Signal” I said. “What’s Signal?” was the reply to which I had to put my phone down and take a breath before replying, “Oh, young one…”</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-tip-line-strategy">Your Tip Line Strategy<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/why-a-signal-tip-line-isnt-enough#your-tip-line-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your Tip Line Strategy" title="Direct link to Your Tip Line Strategy">​</a></h2>
<p>Should you abandon Signal? Absolutely not. But it can’t be your only solution for people to reach you. Other solutions like Proton Mail have emerged as great, lower-friction options, but as of 2023, even they only have 100M users, less than 2% of all internet users.
On the other hand, email is used by ~4.5B users worldwide. But what’s better than ~4.5B users? What about everyone? Now, let’s talk about Hush Line.</p>
