<p>Hush Line is a general-purpose anonymous reporting tool that can be used across a range of industries. In this article, we'll explore how journalists and newsrooms can quickly get started with a Hush Line account that'll enable anyone with an internet connection to reach you without downloading a new app or creating an account.</p>
<p>I've been working on private messengers for a while. In 2016, I worked on Signal's first desktop app redesign. Around the same time, I started working on OnionShare. This peer-to-peer file transfer tool uses the Tor Network to create ephemeral anonymous connections for leaking sources to journalists. The work led me to contribute to CalyxOS, a de-Googled Android OS, for a few years and eventually join the Board of Advisors for Distributed Denial of Secrets. This non-profit publishes and archives public interest hacked and leaked documents.</p>
<p>I love usability. My career has been as a product designer and user researcher for a Big Tech enterprise organization, where I worked on many exciting projects, including search, identity and authentication, voice, and more. But my passion for public interest work outweighed enterprise software, and I left to start Science &amp; Design and then create our first product, Hush Line.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-hush-line">What is Hush Line?<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/newsrooms-and-journalists#what-is-hush-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Hush Line?" title="Direct link to What is Hush Line?">​</a></h2>
<p>Hush Line is a SaaS (software as a service) platform where anyone who needs a tip line can easily sign up for free. We already have journalists from ABC News, Mother Jones, Reveal, BBC, and more, and the service enables anyone in the public to reach them anonymously. Communications are end-to-end encrypted, and whistleblowers do not need to create an account or download any apps, including Tor Browser, in order to send a secure and private message that only the tip line owner can read.</p>
<p>We're different from other tools familiar to journalists, including SecureDrop and GlobaLeaks, because these options are self-hosted, meaning you need to run your own software or hardware infrastructure to use them. Conversely, Hush Line enables anyone to sign up for an account on a centralized service, eliminating the need for self-hosting. We're also free. Other solutions mean paying developers, buying specialized hardware, training staff, and following prescriptive workflows.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-use-hush-line">How to Use Hush Line<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/newsrooms-and-journalists#how-to-use-hush-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Use Hush Line" title="Direct link to How to Use Hush Line">​</a></h2>
<p>After signing up, you only need to add an encryption key to start receiving messages. If you use Proton Mail, it's as simple as entering your Proton address, and we'll import your public key into Hush Line! Now, when you receive rich notifications back to that same email address, your tips will seamlessly and automatically be decrypted in your inbox!</p>

<p>Include a descriptive bio and additional links in your profile details that point to your profiles on your newsroom websites, personal social media accounts, Signal username, or anything else that'll act as social proofs to help your community confirm authenticity.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Profile Settings" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/settings-52bca3e9975b743f52a009d2684272fd.png" width="2648" height="1844" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Adding a self-authenticating or verified URL is easy and helps us fast-track your account verification process. Just add a link to your Hush Line profile on your website, and include&nbsp;rel="me"&nbsp;in the anchor tag. Then, add your website to your profile details on Hush Line, and you'll see a checkmark appear.&nbsp;<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a full tutorial on adding verified URLs</a>.</p>

<p>We offer free verified accounts to journalists and newsrooms. Once your account is ready, send a message to the <a href="https://tips.hushline.app/to/admin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hush Line Admin account</a>, including your Hush Line profile and a way to contact you if it's not already in your profile details.</p>

<p>In order for people to know they can send you messages on Hush Line, they have to know you use it! The easiest and best way to share your tip line to ensure plausible deniability for sources is to share widely. Add a link to your Hush Line profile on your social media accounts, in your email signature, on your personal and professional websites, or anywhere else someone might go to attempt to contact you.</p>
<p>We already have received reports that users have received helpful messages from places with censored internet access.</p>

<p>If someone comes to the Hush Line User Directory looking for someone who can help make your profile discoverable, there can be a difference between success and failure for them. Just toggle the option on in your Profile settings, and you'll be listed where visitors can find you.</p>

<p>One of Hush Line's strengths is offering free Verified badges to tip line owners who want to prevent phishing attacks by adding an additional measure of authenticity to their accounts...</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-link-to-your-hush-line-account">Step 1: Link To Your Hush Line Account<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line#step-1-link-to-your-hush-line-account" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Link To Your Hush Line Account" title="Direct link to Step 1: Link To Your Hush Line Account">​</a></h2>
<p>On a website that you own, or if you're a legal representative of a business on a site you have control of, add a link to your Hush Line profile. It can be located anywhere, but must include <code>rel="me"</code> in the link. For example:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&lt;a href="https://tips.hushline.app/to/myaccount" rel="me"&gt;Message me on Hush Line&lt;/a&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Note that your link doesn't have to say <code>Message me on Hush Line</code>, it just must contain <code>rel="me"</code> and point to your profile.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-2-update-your-bio">Step 2: Update Your Bio<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line#step-2-update-your-bio" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Update Your Bio" title="Direct link to Step 2: Update Your Bio">​</a></h2>
<p>In your Hush Line settings, from the <code>Profile</code> tab, scroll to find <code>Profile Details</code>. You'll see four fields in which you can add any information that helps your community trust that your profile belongs to you. One of those fields should be to the website whose link you just added to your Hush Line address.</p>
<p>When you click <code>Update Bio</code> we will automatically verify that the code from Step 1 exists, and you'll see a new checkmark!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Verified URL wireframe" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/verified-url-83a01aad6936f85168f297bd3b3e1363.png" width="1150" height="876" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-3-check-your-profile">Step 3: Check Your Profile<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line#step-3-check-your-profile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 3: Check Your Profile" title="Direct link to Step 3: Check Your Profile">​</a></h2>
<p>Once you verify a URL, anyone who visits your profile will see a checkmark, demonstrating that you own or control the listed website.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Encryption settings wireframe" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/cover-45d39fa572b924dfb0d5ac8ba038a159.png" width="3834" height="1880" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I love Signal. I was almost their first full-time designer when the team was only four people with a physical office back in the Mission in San Francisco. I turned the offer down because I was too junior in my career to feel like I could be as effective as I knew I could be with more time at the Big Tech company I worked for...</p>
<p>...I volunteered, rejecting even being paid for my time since I had a job that paid enough. And I personally use Signal almost exclusively, so there’s no shade when I say emphatically (especially looking at you, journalists), “Signal is not enough!” Below, we’ll look at internet and messaging usage data in the United States to inform a data-informed tip line strategy.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-data">The Data<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/why-a-signal-tip-line-isnt-enough#the-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Data" title="Direct link to The Data">​</a></h2>
<p>There’s a particular bias against anything but Signal if you’re a journalist in the US, but this bias seriously hurts your potential impact. When I worked with the team, adoption was one of the biggest problems to solve as they were hovering around 100K users, even with the stamp of approval from Snowden. Now, the app has had a nearly 700x increase in users at around 70M globally! It’s excellent news for the team at Signal — a foundation was created (just for Signal), a billionaire is their chairman, and their future is all but guaranteed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Encryption settings wireframe" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/signal-users-99a2078a3cc2a3d44a70bcc8eeaf17d4.webp" width="1530" height="750" class="img_ev3q">
Signal Users Globally from 2019–2024
However the total number of internet users in 2025 is ~5.5B worldwide, and Signal is but ~1.3% of that total share.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Encryption settings wireframe" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/internet-users-27aa2f089a393cef17ddb978a395f37b.png" width="1456" height="962" class="img_ev3q">
Total Internet and Social Users in 2025
Okay, so Signal might have a modest share of the total pie, but people in the US must get it, right? Looking at the top messaging apps, it doesn’t seem so. In fact, Signal isn’t in the top 10.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Encryption settings wireframe" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/phone-usage-ce9c916c300213456dc98d22f3c12189.png" width="1446" height="1220" class="img_ev3q">
Top Messaging Apps in the United States
Here’s a personal story that I think about all the time. When I was working with the team, Moxie traveled down to Menlo Park to personally work with the WhatsApp team to integrate the Signal Protocol. It was a normal, slow morning when he said that it was done and deployed, almost as an “oh, by the way,” kind of thing, and it was at that moment, my mind exploded. Just like that, 1,000,000,000 (one billion) WhatsApp users worldwide had the strongest encryption on the market. Now, it’s used by two of the top four most-used messaging apps in the world, so by all counts, the scale of their positive impact deserves a Nobel Prize, in my opinion. Having said that, Signal itself isn’t among the top 10 most used apps in the United States.
A more recent story: I was visiting one of my besties, whose son I’m the godfather of, who is now 19 years old and studying cybersecurity. Since my career has been in software, and most recently in the security and privacy space, I was eager to introduce him to influential people I know and to try to give him real-world experience, maybe with work on Hush Line. “If I’m going to intro you to ppl, let’s move to Signal” I said. “What’s Signal?” was the reply to which I had to put my phone down and take a breath before replying, “Oh, young one…”</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="your-tip-line-strategy">Your Tip Line Strategy<a href="https://hushline.app/library/blog/why-a-signal-tip-line-isnt-enough#your-tip-line-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your Tip Line Strategy" title="Direct link to Your Tip Line Strategy">​</a></h2>
<p>Should you abandon Signal? Absolutely not. But it can’t be your only solution for people to reach you. Other solutions like Proton Mail have emerged as great, lower-friction options, but as of 2023, even they only have 100M users, less than 2% of all internet users.
On the other hand, email is used by ~4.5B users worldwide. But what’s better than ~4.5B users? What about everyone? Now, let’s talk about Hush Line.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Encryption settings wireframe" src="https://hushline.app/library/assets/images/submit-message-2c17c1d23f788340668ce0cb3ae61fb6.png" width="1213" height="994" class="img_ev3q">
Anyone internet user can send a message
Hush Line is our anonymous reporting platform that doesn’t require internet users to create an account or download any apps to use. Tip Line owners can have messages forwarded to their email service of choice, and messages are end-to-end encrypted. Someone submitting a message with an elevated threat model can use our Onion Service to access Hush Line anonymously using Tor Browser.</p>

<p>The best news? We’re free, open-source, and non-profit managed. Our team has worked on the most ubiquitous secure messaging platforms in the world, and we deeply care about making it easy for whistleblowers to find help. Are you making it harder than it needs to be for vulnerable people who need help? If you’re only using Signal, the answer is yes.
