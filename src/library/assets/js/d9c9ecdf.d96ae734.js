Legislation requiring companies to have internal and external methods of confidential reporting is active in the EU, and states in the US, including California, require companies to publicize the State\'s Attorney General\'s Office hotline phone number. At the same time, federal whistleblower protections are eroding at breakneck speed.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIf you work at a larger organization, you\'ve probably been asked to fill out \\"anonymous\\" surveys about team and company health, ways to improve, etc. Laughably, many times, these anonymous forms are actually logged-in Google Forms that are in no way anonymous.\\n\\n## DNS Monitoring\\n\\nFor remote workers, you\'re probably familiar with using VPNs to access work servers, email, or other internal-only things. VPNs for work allow you to operate as if you were in the office on an internal network. Here\'s an example from my home network\'s DNS logs:\\n\\n\\n| Time                  | Type  | Domain                          | Client            | Status                                 | Response               |\\n|-----------------------|------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|------|\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | A     | tips.hushline.app             | glenns-m3     | OK (answered by localhost#5335) | IP (7.0ms)  |\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | HTTPS | tips.hushline.app             | glenns-m3     | OK (answered by localhost#5335) | CNAME (141.5ms) |\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | A     | hushline.app             | glenns-m3.pivpn    | OK (answered by localhost#5335) | CNAME (33.8ms)|\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | A     | checkonline.home-assistant.io | 192.168.0.166 | OK (already forwarded)     | N/A        |\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | A     | checkonline.home-assistant.io | 192.168.0.166 | OK (answered by localhost#5335) | IP (7.6ms) |\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | A     | s1.openairinfo.com            | 192.168.0.117 | OK (answered by localhost#5335) | IP (7.0ms)  |\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | AAAA  | s1.openairinfo.com            | 192.168.0.117 | OK (cache)                 | NODATA (0.0ms) |\\n| 2025-03-16 12:18:17  | AAAA  | s1.openairinfo.com            | 192.168.0.117 | OK (cache)                 | NODATA (0.0ms) |\\n\\nSince I\'ve given my computer a custom hostname, instead of seeing an internal IP address, which\xa0could\xa0tell you a lot, I can easily find my computer with a human-readable name. Now, if someone runs a company and receives a report of serious allegations of wrongdoing, they can do one of a few things: 1. take the tip, act on it, and save lots of money, or, 2. find the person who submitted the report and \\"fix\\" the problem. Most of the time, companies choose option 2. If I access the network using a VPN, the logs are no different.\\n\\nSo, if on March 16th at around noon, a company receives a tip that threatens to go to the press if action isn\'t taken, all they need to do is look back through their network logs to see who visited the tip line then. \\"But the system is anonymous because I didn\'t have to log in to submit a message!\\" No, sorry. \\"But it\'s end-to-end encrypted!\\" That only means that only the intended recipient can read the message, but in this case, I don\'t need to know the contents of the message; I just need to know who sent it.\\n\\n## The Dangers of MDM and EDR Software\\n\\nSome employers ask employees to install MDM (mobile device management) software on their personal devices. DO NOT DO THIS! MDM software enables monitoring of the contents of your phone, including the ability to add or remove apps, check your contacts, monitor your location, view browsing history and network connections, and see a full list of the applications you have installed. It\'s basically an administrator account run by your company. Does\xa0any\xa0app your company offers have a custom keyboard? These can log your keystrokes, so switch back to a system keyboard if possible. If your company uses EDR (endpoint detection and response) software, it can log keystrokes for forensic analysis, including texts sent over any application, including Signal.\\n\\n## What to do Instead?\\n\\nIt\'s best to use a personal device on a private network or that you own, including your phone. Again, no corporate MDM or EDR software should be present on your device. One way to check if anything is installed currently is to check for \\"Profiles\\" in your phone\'s settings. Nothing from your company or anything else you don\'t recognize should be there.\\n\\n### Low Threat Scenarios\\n\\nIn most situations, people want to report non-sensitive information. Using your personal device on a non-work network is perfect for this scenario. App owners could add IP address logging, but in this case, your IP will only show general location information. If that IP address becomes caught up in illegal activity elsewhere, law enforcement could subpoena the issuing ISP for customer information.\\n\\n### Medium to High Threat Scenarios\\n\\n#### Non-Onion Services\\n\\nWhen someone does have reason to worry about using a tip line, including when disclosing serious issues of governmental corruption, national security, or other ethical or legal concerns, they may use our native Onion services. Using Tor Browser with an Onion service enables the highest levels of protection, because connections never leave the Tor Anonymizing Network. \\n\\n![Tor Regular Connections](./tor-regular.png)\\n\\n#### Onion Connections\\n\\nWhen you connect to a normal website on Tor Browser, it uses a volunteer computer to exit the network and connect to that website. Theoretically, the exit computer could be compromised, and the originating requester could be deanonymized. This isn\'t possible using a .onion address because there is no exit connecting to the normal internet.\\n\\n![Tor Regular Connections](./tor-onion.png)"},{"id":"hushline-sustainable-model","metadata":{"permalink":"/library/blog/hushline-sustainable-model","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-03-16-hushline-sustainable-model/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-16-hushline-sustainable-model/index.md","title":"Hush Line\'s Sustainable Impact Model","description":"Impact Model Diagram","date":"2025-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Hush Line","permalink":"/library/blog/tags/hushline","description":"Hush Line articles"}],"readingTime":7.525,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Glenn Sorrentino","title":"Executive Director, Science & Design","url":"https://scidsg.org","page":{"permalink":"/library/blog/authors/gsorrentino"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/glenn-sorrentino"},"imageURL":"/library/img/glenn.jpg","key":"gsorrentino"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hushline-sustainable-model","title":"Hush Line\'s Sustainable Impact Model","subtitle":"Business can do better.

Grants seem harder and harder to come by, and the cost of maintaining software services is ongoing. We were honored to receive a grant from the Data Empowerment Fund for $100k; it enabled us to reach a stable, robust, production-ready state, enabling our first paying customers and many more free users. But another grant we were crossing our fingers for fell through, and it\'s a reminder that this cannot be our primary funding source for stable, long-term infrastructure.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThis realization is not new - I understood the scarcity of funding compared to the for-profit world. It was a lesson learned quickly, and as someone with a career as a product designer, SaaS seemed like an obvious solution to a ubiquitous problem in my new industry. This is not only an obvious solution but also one with a significant monetary upside that, and combined with our 501(c)(3) structure, offers a compelling model for self-sustainability and community empowerment.\\n\\n## The Consumer Non-Profit Software Landscape\\n\\nIf you work outside the tech or tech-adjacent industries, you\'ll be hard-pressed to name a single non-profit or open-source piece of software, let alone one you use. You\'ll probably be able to name a lot of consumer alternatives - Google, Apple, Dropbox, Outlook, Slack - though all of these use open-source software to drive their closed-source development, their model is to charge a lot, make it expensive to leave, and lock you into a system to which you become dependent. \\n\\n### The Problem With For-Profit Software\\n\\nThe astronomical profits Big Tech companies make create new record levels of wealth inequality that allow Big Tech CEOs to [displace communities and businesses for their private use](https://www.npr.org/2024/02/28/1232564250/billionaire-benioff-buys-hawaii-land-salesforce). At the same time, the dream of home ownership is a fading reality for most people.\\n\\n> Hawaii has long been a place where the world\'s elite has flocked. And tech billionaires are now among the newest cadre of migrants to buy land in the islands. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns a sprawling beach mansion in Maui. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg has plans to build a bunker on his land in Kauai, according to Wired. Benioff\'s former boss, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, owns 98% of Lanai. And the list goes on.\\n\\n> What\'s different here is that rather than focusing on coastal mansions in gated communities, Benioff is buying property in a rural residential town. In the majority of instances, he\'s paid more than current market value, according to public records. For example, the longtime Mamane Bakery \u2014 known for its lilikoi cheesecake and mango-guava hot cross buns \u2014 shuttered after he purchased the land for more than 50% above the current market value.\\n\\n### Shifting The Profit Model\\n\\nThe most important part is that the upside for making money is so great that a successful application of it in the non-profit sector could create generational, self-funded charities that are legally required to do good. What if instead of buying for-profit, billionaire-making CRM software, you had an alternative whose profits went to reforming corruption in business? Instead of fighting for $100,000, what if an organization could organically make 100x that and give a large portion away?\\n\\nThis is our opportunity with Hush Line. Anonymous reporting is a cross-industry need, legally mandated in some sectors and countries. Open-source software is our development model, enabling community review of our source code and other organizations and individuals to use our software for free. Even though anyone can install our platform themselves, we understand that most people and organizations are non-technical and cannot operate and maintain their own software infrastructure. Additionally, if you\'re buying security software, it\'s imperative to know that the code treats your data the way the makers say it is.\\n\\n## Monetization & Distribution Model\\n\\n![Hush Line Monetization Model](./monetization-model.png)\\n\\n### Software\\n\\n#### SaaS\\n\\nIf you visit `hushline.app` to create an account, you\'re using our software as a service (SaaS) platform. A free tier offers most people everything they need for a secure, anonymous tip line. We have a low-cost paid tier or licensed managed single-tenant instances for businesses or professionals who require more features. For developers, hobbyists, or businesses with technical proficiency, anyone can freely install and use all of Hush Line\'s features.\\n\\n#### PaaS\\n\\nSome organizations may want their own independent app and infrastructure instead of using `hushline.app`. In this case, we offer managed single-tenant instances that are perfect for all sizes of business. We can rapidly deploy to the same infrastructure that the core Hush Line platform uses, or tailor any deployment to the needs of the organization. Costs are similar to ours, but end up being cheaper since only the main service uses a staging infrastructure.\\n\\n### Hardware\\n\\n For high-risk tip line owners who do not want to trust any third-party services, we offer a hardware device that runs Hush Line locally as an Onion Service; higher security and anonymity are critical for their work for a smaller audience \u2014 human rights defenders, investigative journalists, or high-profile lawyers. We offer devices for $500 that are fully self-contained, Tor-only Hush Line instances. If your threat model is one in which you cannot trust any third-party infrastructure, this is your best option.\\n\\n![Personal Server](./personal-server.png)\\n\\n## The Opportunity\\n\\nIf successful, the market opportunity will be [$238m in 2025, growing to over $300m in 2032](https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/market-insight/whistleblowing-software-market-4595\\n). Even on the very low end, becoming profitable is possible. It only takes about $3,000 to operate Hush Line\'s software annually. Once we surpass the point of platform financial stability, we will have money that will go toward more than making a few people rich.\\n\\n## Whistleblower Fund\\n\\nAs with any charitable cause, people are the point, and the folks we\'re helping are whistleblowers. These individuals often lose their careers and life savings and can suffer from significant mental health issues. To address this, we\'re starting a new whistleblower fund that will directly support whistleblowers\' pragmatic needs, with a small portion reserved for the development and maintenance of the Hush Line platform. \\n\\n### Governance\\n\\nThough the specifics are undecided at the moment, the fund may be a new independent non-profit, governed by former whistleblowers, whistleblower lawyers, and others.\xa0\\n\\n\\n### Funding Goals\\n\\nIf we chose a 70/30 distribution model, we would need recurring $1,000/mo donations, combined with sales, to \\"keep the lights on.\\"\\n\\nIdeally, we could afford ~10 hours/mo for an engineering contractor, around $2,000. To get to this amount, we\'d need to raise or earn around $7,500/mo with the same 70/30 distribution for Hush Line to earn enough to cover everything needed. Eventually, as the fund grew in popularity, we could even sustain a full-time team.\\n\\nIn a perfect world, we can have a full team, which would require about 6-12 people, requiring $6,000,000 ARR (annual recurring revenue), giving Hush Line a $150,000 monthly budget, and providing $350,000 every month for direct whistleblower support!\\n\\n#### Financial Support With a 70/30 Distribution\\n\\n| Milestone | MRR | ARR | Monthly Hush Line Support | Monthly Whistlblower Support\\n|--|--|--|--|--|\\n| \ud83d\udca1 Keeping the lights on | $1,000 | $12,000 | $300 | $700 | \\n| \u2764\ufe0f 1 Contractor, Infra | $7,666 | $92,000 | $2,300 | $5,367 |\\n| \ud83e\udd29 Shangri La (6 Full-Time Employees, Infra) | $500,000 | $6,000,000 | $150,000 | $350,000 |\\n\\n\\n## Obstacles\\n\\nWhile it seems straightforward, we face significant obstacles. The new organization governing the fund still needs to be formed. Will a 501(c)(3) be approved that explicitly supports whistleblowers? Federal staff have been laid off in record numbers, and the regulatory situation in the US government is tenuous at best.\\n\\nAdoption is the largest barrier to success. While we don\'t need much, we\'re the new kid on the block, and as a non-profit with exactly $0 for advertising or sales as of writing this, it\'s a slow game. Large non-profits like Wikimedia, Signal, or Tor have a large and loyal donor-base. We\'re entering the industry during difficult economic and political times, and asking working people for their limited funds is a delicate thing.\\n\\nThere always seems to be more than one top priority when building software, but security is among the most important. Offering a centralized service makes you a target, and if we ever experience a data breach, it could cause significant reputational damage. Security is a moving target requiring constant vigilance and proactivity. Our engineering team is made up of security experts and industry leaders, but nothing is perfectly secure, and people are fallible.\\n\\n## How We Get There\\n\\nThis year, we\'ll start the formation of the new fund and assemble a governing board that will ensure the funds are used as stated in our mission goals. \\n\\nThe individuals who oversee the fund will have a first-hand understanding of the battles people who speak up face: whistleblower lawyers, former whistleblowers, journalists, or others who support the needs of people engaging in responsible disclosure.\\n\\nDo you know someone who should be on the Board?

In this article, we\'ll explore how journalists and newsrooms can quickly get started with a Hush Line account that\'ll enable anyone with an internet connection to reach you without downloading a new app or creating an account.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI\'ve been working on private messengers for a while. In 2016, I worked on Signal\'s first desktop app redesign. Around the same time, I started working on OnionShare. This peer-to-peer file transfer tool uses the Tor Network to create ephemeral anonymous connections for leaking sources to journalists. The work led me to contribute to CalyxOS, a de-Googled Android OS, for a few years and eventually join the Board of Advisors for Distributed Denial of Secrets. This non-profit publishes and archives public interest hacked and leaked documents.\\n\\nI love usability. My career has been as a product designer and user researcher for a Big Tech enterprise organization, where I worked on many exciting projects, including search, identity and authentication, voice, and more. But my passion for public interest work outweighed enterprise software, and I left to start Science & Design and then create our first product, Hush Line.\\n\\n## What is Hush Line?\\n\\nHush Line is a SaaS (software as a service) platform where anyone who needs a tip line can easily sign up for free. We already have journalists from ABC News, Mother Jones, Reveal, BBC, and more, and the service enables anyone in the public to reach them anonymously. Communications are end-to-end encrypted, and whistleblowers do not need to create an account or download any apps, including Tor Browser, in order to send a secure and private message that only the tip line owner can read.\\n\\nWe\'re different from other tools familiar to journalists, including SecureDrop and GlobaLeaks, because these options are self-hosted, meaning you need to run your own software or hardware infrastructure to use them. Conversely, Hush Line enables anyone to sign up for an account on a centralized service, eliminating the need for self-hosting. We\'re also free. Other solutions mean paying developers, buying specialized hardware, training staff, and following prescriptive workflows.\\n\\n## How to Use Hush Line\\n\\nAfter signing up, you only need to add an encryption key to start receiving messages. If you use Proton Mail, it\'s as simple as entering your Proton address, and we\'ll import your public key into Hush Line! Now, when you receive rich notifications back to that same email address, your tips will seamlessly and automatically be decrypted in your inbox!\\n\\n![Encryption Settings](./encryption.png)\\n\\n### Add Information About Yourself\\n\\nInclude a descriptive bio and additional links in your profile details that point to your profiles on your newsroom websites, personal social media accounts, Signal username, or anything else that\'ll act as social proofs to help your community confirm authenticity.\\n\\n![Profile Settings](./settings.png)\\n\\n#### Self-Authenticating URLs\\n\\nAdding a self-authenticating or verified URL is easy and helps us fast-track your account verification process. Just add a link to your Hush Line profile on your website, and include\xa0rel=\\"me\\"\xa0in the anchor tag. Then, add your website to your profile details on Hush Line, and you\'ll see a checkmark appear.\xa0[Here\'s a full tutorial on adding verified URLs](https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line).\\n\\n### Request Account Verification\\n\\nWe offer free verified accounts to journalists and newsrooms. Once your account is ready, send a message to the [Hush Line Admin account](https://tips.hushline.app/to/admin), including your Hush Line profile and a way to contact you if it\'s not already in your profile details.\\n\\n## Publicize Your Address\\n\\nIn order for people to know they can send you messages on Hush Line, they have to know you use it! The easiest and best way to share your tip line to ensure plausible deniability for sources is to share widely. Add a link to your Hush Line profile on your social media accounts, in your email signature, on your personal and professional websites, or anywhere else someone might go to attempt to contact you.\\n\\nWe already have received reports that users have received helpful messages from places with censored internet access.\\n\\n### Add to Your Social Profile\\n\\nFun fact: I started contributing to OnionShare because I found Micah Lee\'s Signal contact on his Twitter bio and reached out, and we\'ve continued collaborating on it for years. With Hush Line, the person sending a message doesn\'t need to be a user of the platform or download an app, as in the case with Signal.\\n\\n[Joshua Byrd](https://tips.hushline.app/to/phocks), a journalist at ABC News, adds a link to his Hush Line account on his Mastodon profile:\\n\\n![Mastodon](./mastodon.png)\\n\\n### Add Yourself to the User Directory\\n\\nIf someone comes to the Hush Line User Directory looking for someone who can help make your profile discoverable, there can be a difference between success and failure for them. Just toggle the option in your Profile settings, and you\'ll be listed where visitors can find you.\\n\\n![Directory Settings](./settings-directory.png)\\n\\n[Daniel Schulman](https://tips.hushline.app/to/danielschulman), deputy editor for news and politics at Mother Jones and the Center for Investigative Reporting, has opted into the directory so anyone can send him an anonymous, end-to-end encrypted message!\\n\\n![Daniel listing](./directory-listing.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSetting up Hush Line is so easy you\'ll wonder why you haven\'t done it sooner.

I was almost their first full-time designer when the team was only four people with a physical office back in the Mission in San Francisco. I turned the offer down because I was too junior in my career to feel like I could be as effective as I knew I could be with more time at the Big Tech company I worked for... \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n...I volunteered, rejecting even being paid for my time since I had a job that paid enough. And I personally use Signal almost exclusively, so there\u2019s no shade when I say emphatically (especially looking at you, journalists), \u201cSignal is not enough!\u201d Below, we\u2019ll look at internet and messaging usage data in the United States to inform a data-informed tip line strategy.\\n\\n## The Data\\nThere\u2019s a particular bias against anything but Signal if you\u2019re a journalist in the US, but this bias seriously hurts your potential impact. When I worked with the team, adoption was one of the biggest problems to solve as they were hovering around 100K users, even with the stamp of approval from Snowden. Now, the app has had a nearly 700x increase in users at around 70M globally! It\u2019s excellent news for the team at Signal \u2014 a foundation was created (just for Signal), a billionaire is their chairman, and their future is all but guaranteed.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./signal-users.webp)\\nSignal Users Globally from 2019\u20132024\\nHowever the total number of internet users in 2025 is ~5.5B worldwide, and Signal is but ~1.3% of that total share.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./internet-users.png)\\nTotal Internet and Social Users in 2025\\nOkay, so Signal might have a modest share of the total pie, but people in the US must get it, right? Looking at the top messaging apps, it doesn\u2019t seem so. In fact, Signal isn\u2019t in the top 10.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./phone-usage.png)\\nTop Messaging Apps in the United States\\nHere\u2019s a personal story that I think about all the time. When I was working with the team, Moxie traveled down to Menlo Park to personally work with the WhatsApp team to integrate the Signal Protocol. It was a normal, slow morning when he said that it was done and deployed, almost as an \u201coh, by the way,\u201d kind of thing, and it was at that moment, my mind exploded. Just like that, 1,000,000,000 (one billion) WhatsApp users worldwide had the strongest encryption on the market. Now, it\u2019s used by two of the top four most-used messaging apps in the world, so by all counts, the scale of their positive impact deserves a Nobel Prize, in my opinion. Having said that, Signal itself isn\u2019t among the top 10 most used apps in the United States.\\nA more recent story: I was visiting one of my besties, whose son I\u2019m the godfather of, who is now 19 years old and studying cybersecurity. Since my career has been in software, and most recently in the security and privacy space, I was eager to introduce him to influential people I know and to try to give him real-world experience, maybe with work on Hush Line. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to intro you to ppl, let\u2019s move to Signal\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s Signal?\u201d was the reply to which I had to put my phone down and take a breath before replying, \u201cOh, young one\u2026\u201d\\n\\n## Your Tip Line Strategy\\nShould you abandon Signal? Absolutely not. But it can\u2019t be your only solution for people to reach you. Other solutions like Proton Mail have emerged as great, lower-friction options, but as of 2023, even they only have 100M users, less than 2% of all internet users.\\nOn the other hand, email is used by ~4.5B users worldwide. But what\u2019s better than ~4.5B users? What about everyone? Now, let\u2019s talk about Hush Line.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./submit-message.png)\\nAnyone internet user can send a message\\nHush Line is our anonymous reporting platform that doesn\u2019t require internet users to create an account or download any apps to use. Tip Line owners can have messages forwarded to their email service of choice, and messages are end-to-end encrypted. Someone submitting a message with an elevated threat model can use our Onion Service to access Hush Line anonymously using Tor Browser.\\n\\n## Get Going\\nThe best news?
