In this article, we\'ll explore how journalists and newsrooms can quickly get started with a Hush Line account that\'ll enable anyone with an internet connection to reach you without downloading a new app or creating an account.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nI\'ve been working on private messengers for a while. In 2016, I worked on Signal\'s first desktop app redesign. Around the same time, I started working on OnionShare. This peer-to-peer file transfer tool uses the Tor Network to create ephemeral anonymous connections for leaking sources to journalists. The work led me to contribute to CalyxOS, a de-Googled Android OS, for a few years and eventually join the Board of Advisors for Distributed Denial of Secrets. This non-profit publishes and archives public interest hacked and leaked documents.\\n\\nI love usability. My career has been as a product designer and user researcher for a Big Tech enterprise organization, where I worked on many exciting projects, including search, identity and authentication, voice, and more. But my passion for public interest work outweighed enterprise software, and I left to start Science & Design and then create our first product, Hush Line.\\n\\n## What is Hush Line?\\n\\nHush Line is a SaaS (software as a service) platform where anyone who needs a tip line can easily sign up for free. We already have journalists from ABC News, Mother Jones, Reveal, BBC, and more, and the service enables anyone in the public to reach them anonymously. Communications are end-to-end encrypted, and whistleblowers do not need to create an account or download any apps, including Tor Browser, in order to send a secure and private message that only the tip line owner can read.\\n\\nWe\'re different from other tools familiar to journalists, including SecureDrop and GlobaLeaks, because these options are self-hosted, meaning you need to run your own software or hardware infrastructure to use them. Conversely, Hush Line enables anyone to sign up for an account on a centralized service, eliminating the need for self-hosting. We\'re also free. Other solutions mean paying developers, buying specialized hardware, training staff, and following prescriptive workflows.\\n\\n## How to Use Hush Line\\n\\nAfter signing up, you only need to add an encryption key to start receiving messages. If you use Proton Mail, it\'s as simple as entering your Proton address, and we\'ll import your public key into Hush Line! Now, when you receive rich notifications back to that same email address, your tips will seamlessly and automatically be decrypted in your inbox!\\n\\n![Encryption Settings](./encryption.png)\\n\\n### Add Information About Yourself\\n\\nInclude a descriptive bio and additional links in your profile details that point to your profiles on your newsroom websites, personal social media accounts, Signal username, or anything else that\'ll act as social proofs to help your community confirm authenticity.\\n\\n![Profile Settings](./settings.png)\\n\\n#### Self-Authenticating URLs\\n\\nAdding a self-authenticating or verified URL is easy and helps us fast-track your account verification process. Just add a link to your Hush Line profile on your website, and include\xa0rel=\\"me\\"\xa0in the anchor tag. Then, add your website to your profile details on Hush Line, and you\'ll see a checkmark appear.\xa0[Here\'s a full tutorial on adding verified URLs](https://hushline.app/library/blog/how-to-verify-an-address-on-hush-line).\\n\\n### Request Account Verification\\n\\nWe offer free verified accounts to journalists and newsrooms. Once your account is ready, send a message to the [Hush Line Admin account](https://tips.hushline.app/to/admin), including your Hush Line profile and a way to contact you if it\'s not already in your profile details.\\n\\n## Publicize Your Address\\n\\nIn order for people to know they can send you messages on Hush Line, they have to know you use it! The easiest and best way to share your tip line to ensure plausible deniability for sources is to share widely. Add a link to your Hush Line profile on your social media accounts, in your email signature, on your personal and professional websites, or anywhere else someone might go to attempt to contact you.\\n\\nWe already have received reports that users have received helpful messages from places with censored internet access.\\n\\n### Add Yourself to the User Directory\\n\\nIf someone comes to the Hush Line User Directory looking for someone who can help make your profile discoverable, there can be a difference between success and failure for them. Just toggle the option on in your Profile settings, and you\'ll be listed where visitors can find you.\\n\\n![Directory Settings](./settings-directory.png)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSetting up Hush Line is so easy you\'ll wonder why you haven\'t done it sooner.

You\'ll see four fields in which you can add any information that helps your community trust that your profile belongs to you.

I was almost their first full-time designer when the team was only four people with a physical office back in the Mission in San Francisco. I turned the offer down because I was too junior in my career to feel like I could be as effective as I knew I could be with more time at the Big Tech company I worked for... \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n...I volunteered, rejecting even being paid for my time since I had a job that paid enough. And I personally use Signal almost exclusively, so there\u2019s no shade when I say emphatically (especially looking at you, journalists), \u201cSignal is not enough!\u201d Below, we\u2019ll look at internet and messaging usage data in the United States to inform a data-informed tip line strategy.\\n\\n## The Data\\nThere\u2019s a particular bias against anything but Signal if you\u2019re a journalist in the US, but this bias seriously hurts your potential impact. When I worked with the team, adoption was one of the biggest problems to solve as they were hovering around 100K users, even with the stamp of approval from Snowden. Now, the app has had a nearly 700x increase in users at around 70M globally! It\u2019s excellent news for the team at Signal \u2014 a foundation was created (just for Signal), a billionaire is their chairman, and their future is all but guaranteed.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./signal-users.webp)\\nSignal Users Globally from 2019\u20132024\\nHowever the total number of internet users in 2025 is ~5.5B worldwide, and Signal is but ~1.3% of that total share.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./internet-users.png)\\nTotal Internet and Social Users in 2025\\nOkay, so Signal might have a modest share of the total pie, but people in the US must get it, right? Looking at the top messaging apps, it doesn\u2019t seem so. In fact, Signal isn\u2019t in the top 10.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./phone-usage.png)\\nTop Messaging Apps in the United States\\nHere\u2019s a personal story that I think about all the time. When I was working with the team, Moxie traveled down to Menlo Park to personally work with the WhatsApp team to integrate the Signal Protocol. It was a normal, slow morning when he said that it was done and deployed, almost as an \u201coh, by the way,\u201d kind of thing, and it was at that moment, my mind exploded. Just like that, 1,000,000,000 (one billion) WhatsApp users worldwide had the strongest encryption on the market. Now, it\u2019s used by two of the top four most-used messaging apps in the world, so by all counts, the scale of their positive impact deserves a Nobel Prize, in my opinion. Having said that, Signal itself isn\u2019t among the top 10 most used apps in the United States.\\nA more recent story: I was visiting one of my besties, whose son I\u2019m the godfather of, who is now 19 years old and studying cybersecurity. Since my career has been in software, and most recently in the security and privacy space, I was eager to introduce him to influential people I know and to try to give him real-world experience, maybe with work on Hush Line. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to intro you to ppl, let\u2019s move to Signal\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s Signal?\u201d was the reply to which I had to put my phone down and take a breath before replying, \u201cOh, young one\u2026\u201d\\n\\n## Your Tip Line Strategy\\nShould you abandon Signal? Absolutely not. But it can\u2019t be your only solution for people to reach you. Other solutions like Proton Mail have emerged as great, lower-friction options, but as of 2023, even they only have 100M users, less than 2% of all internet users.\\nOn the other hand, email is used by ~4.5B users worldwide. But what\u2019s better than ~4.5B users? What about everyone? Now, let\u2019s talk about Hush Line.\\n\\n![Encryption settings wireframe](./submit-message.png)\\nAnyone internet user can send a message\\nHush Line is our anonymous reporting platform that doesn\u2019t require internet users to create an account or download any apps to use. Tip Line owners can have messages forwarded to their email service of choice, and messages are end-to-end encrypted. Someone submitting a message with an elevated threat model can use our Onion Service to access Hush Line anonymously using Tor Browser.\\n\\n## Get Going\\nThe best news? We\u2019re free, open-source, and non-profit managed. Our team has worked on the most ubiquitous secure messaging platforms in the world, and we deeply care about making it easy for whistleblowers to find help. Are you making it harder than it needs to be for vulnerable people who need help? If you\u2019re only using Signal, the answer is yes.\\nSign up for Hush Line at https://tips.hushline.app/register."}]}}')}}]);
