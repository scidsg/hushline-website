# Page Builder

Quickly create single-page, single-file websites that are accessible, lightweight, and effective.

## Problem

Activists in countries with internet censorship require efficient methods to deploy websites to support their cause, regardless of technical expertise. How quickly content is published can determine success or failure, and even impact someone’s physical safety. A performant and lightweight site will help ensure that people with limited bandwidth and older devices can quickly load the page.
